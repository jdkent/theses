  abstract	= {Author summary Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a
		  non-invasive way to measure human brain structure and
		  activity that has been used for over 25 years. There are
		  thousands MRI studies performed every year generating a
		  substantial amount of data. At the same time, many new data
		  analysis methods are being developed every year. The
		  potential of using new analysis methods on the variety of
		  existing and newly acquired data is hindered by
		  difficulties in software deployment and lack of support for
		  standardized input data. Here we propose to use container
		  technology to make deployment of a wide range of data
		  analysis techniques easy. In addition, we adapt the
		  existing data analysis tools to interface with data
		  organized in a standardized way. We hope that this approach
		  will enable researchers to access a wider range of methods
		  when analyzing their data which will lead to accelerated
		  progress in human neuroscience.},

  abstract	= {Graph theory is a valuable framework to study the
		  organization of functional and anatomical connections in
		  the brain. Its use for comparing network topologies,
		  however, is not without difficulties. Graph measures may be
		  influenced by the number of nodes (N) and the average
		  degree (k) of the network. The explicit form of that
		  influence depends on the type of network topology, which is
		  usually unknown for experimental data. Direct comparisons
		  of graph measures between empirical networks with different
		  N and/or k can therefore yield spurious results. We list
		  benefits and pitfalls of various approaches that intend to
		  overcome these difficulties. We discuss the initial graph
		  definition of unweighted graphs via fixed thresholds,
		  average degrees or edge densities, and the use of weighted
		  graphs. For instance, choosing a threshold to fix N and k
		  does eliminate size and density effects but may lead to
		  modifications of the network by enforcing (ignoring)
		  non-significant (significant) connections. Opposed to
		  fixing N and k, graph measures are often normalized via
		  random surrogates but, in fact, this may even increase the
		  sensitivity to differences in N and k for the commonly used
		  clustering coefficient and small-world index. To avoid such
		  a bias we tried to estimate the N,k-dependence for
		  empirical networks, which can serve to correct for size
		  effects, if successful. We also add a number of methods
		  used in social sciences that build on statistics of local
		  network structures including exponential random graph
		  models and motif counting. We show that none of the
		  here-investigated methods allows for a reliable and fully
		  unbiased comparison, but some perform better than others.},

		  standard deviation of the data after temporal differencing.
		  A limitation of DVARS however is the lack of concrete
		  interpretation of the absolute values of DVARS, and finding
		  a threshold to distinguish bad scans from good. In this
		  work we describe a variance decomposition of the entire 4D
		  dataset that shows DVARS to be just one of three sources of
		  variation we refer to as D-var, S-var and E-var. D-var and
		  S-var partition the average variance between adjacent time
		  points, while E-var accounts for edge effects, and each can
		  be used to make spatial and temporal summary diagnostic
		  measures. Extending the partitioning to global (and
		  non-global) signal leads to a rs-fMRI DSE ANOVA table,
		  which decomposes the total and global variance into fast
		  (D-var), slow (S-var) and edge (E-var) components. We find
		  expected values for each variance component under nominal
		  models, showing how D-var (and thus DVARS) scales with
		  overall variance and is diminished by temporal
		  autocorrelation. Finally we propose a sampling distribution
		  for squared DVARS (a multiple of D-var) and robust methods
		  to estimate this null model, allowing computations of DVARS
		  p-values. We propose that these diagnostic time series,
		  images, p-values and ANOVA table will provide a succinct
		  summary of the quality of a rs-fMRI dataset that will
		  support comparisons of datasets over preprocessing steps
		  and between subjects.},

  abstract	= {Top-down attention is an essential cognitive ability,
		  allowing our finite brains to process complex natural
		  environments by prioritizing information relevant to our
		  goals. Previous evidence suggests that top-down attention
		  operates by modulating stimulus-evoked neural activity
		  within visual areas specialized for processing
		  goal-relevant information. We show that top-down attention
		  also has a separate influence on the background coupling
		  between visual areas: adopting different attentional goals
		  resulted in specific patterns of noise correlations in the
		  visual system, whereby intrinsic activity in the same set
		  of low-level areas was shared with only those high-level
		  areas relevant to the current goal. These changes occurred
		  independently of evoked activity, persisted without visual
		  stimulation, and predicted behavioral success in deploying
		  attention better than the modulation of evoked activity.
		  This attentional switching of background connectivity
		  suggests that attention may help synchronize different
		  levels of the visual processing hierarchy, forming
		  state-dependent functional pathways in human visual cortex
		  to prioritize goal-relevant information.},

  abstract	= {The concept of "inhibition" is widely used in synaptic,
		  circuit, and systems neuroscience, where it has a clear
		  meaning because it is clearly observable. The concept is
		  also ubiquitous in psychology. One common use is to connote
		  an active/willed process underlying cognitive control. Many
		  authors claim that subjects execute cognitive control over
		  unwanted stimuli, task sets, responses, memories, and
		  emotions by inhibiting them, and that frontal lobe damage
		  induces distractibility, impulsivity, and perseveration
		  because of damage to an inhibitory mechanism. However, with
		  the exception of the motor domain, the notion of an active
		  inhibitory process underlying cognitive control has been
		  heavily challenged. Alternative explanations have been
		  provided that explain cognitive control without recourse to
		  inhibition as concept, mechanism, or theory. This article
		  examines the role that neuroscience can play when examining
		  whether the psychological concept of active inhibition can
		  be meaningfully applied in cognitive control research.},

###Article{	  aron2007,
  abstract	= {The concept of "inhibition" is widely used in synaptic,
		  circuit, and systems neuroscience, where it has a clear
		  meaning because it is clearly observable. The concept is
		  also ubiquitous in psychology. One common use is to connote
		  an active/willed process underlying cognitive control. Many
		  authors claim that subjects execute cognitive control over
		  unwanted stimuli, task sets, responses, memories, and
		  emotions by inhibiting them, and that frontal lobe damage
		  induces distractibility, impulsivity, and perseveration
		  because of damage to an inhibitory mechanism. However, with
		  the exception of the motor domain, the notion of an active
		  inhibitory process underlying cognitive control has been
		  heavily challenged. Alternative explanations have been
		  provided that explain cognitive control without recourse to
		  inhibition as concept, mechanism, or theory. This article
		  examines the role that neuroscience can play when examining
		  whether the psychological concept of active inhibition can
		  be meaningfully applied in cognitive control research.},

@Article{	  avelar-pereira2017,
  abstract	= {Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) can identify large-scale
		  brain networks, including the default mode (DMN),
		  frontoparietal control (FPN) and dorsal attention (DAN)
		  networks. Interactions among these networks are critical
		  for supporting complex cognitive functions, yet the way in
		  which they are modulated across states is not well
		  understood. Moreover, it remains unclear whether these
		  interactions are similarly affected in aging regardless of
		  cognitive state. In this study, we investigated age-related
		  differences in functional interactions among the DMN, FPN
		  and DAN during rest and the Multi-Source Interference task
		  (MSIT). Networks were identified using independent
		  component analysis (ICA), and functional connectivity was
		  measured during rest and task. We found that the FPN was
		  more coupled with the DMN during rest and with the DAN
		  during the MSIT. The degree of FPN-DMN connectivity was
		  lower in older compared to younger adults, whereas no
		  age-related differences were observed in FPN-DAN
		  connectivity in either state. This suggests that dynamic
		  interactions of the FPN are stable across cognitive states.
		  The DMN and DAN were anti correlated and age-sensitive
		  during the MSIT only, indicating variation in a
		  task-dependent manner. Increased levels of anticorrelation
		  from rest to task also predicted successful interference
		  resolution. Additional analyses revealed that the degree of
		  DMN-DAN anticorrelation during the MSIT was associated to
		  resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) within the DMN. This
		  suggests that reduced DMN neural activity during rest
		  underlies an impaired ability to achieve higher levels of
		  anticorrelation during a task. Taken together, our results
		  suggest that only parts of age-related differences in
		  connectivity are uncovered at rest and thus, should be
		  studied in the functional connectome across multiple states
		  for a more comprehensive picture.},

		  to produce those actions, based on our goals and knowledge.
		  The frontal lobes are necessary for cognitive control at
		  all levels of abstraction. Recent neuroimaging data have
		  motivated the hypothesis that the frontal lobes are
		  organized hierarchically, such that control is supported in
		  progressively caudal regions as decisions are made at more
		  concrete levels of action. We found that frontal damage
		  impaired action decisions at a level of abstraction that
		  was dependent on lesion location (rostral lesions affected
		  more abstract tasks, whereas caudal lesions affected more
		  concrete tasks), in addition to impairing tasks requiring
		  more, but not less, abstract action control. Moreover, two
		  adjacent regions were distinguished on the basis of the
		  level of control, consistent with previous functional
		  magnetic resonance imaging results. These results provide
		  direct evidence for a rostro-caudal hierarchical
		  organization of the frontal lobes. The function of the
		  prefrontal cortex (PFC) is closely associated with
		  cognitive control or the ability of humans and other
		  primates to internally guide behavior in accordance with
		  goals, plans and broader contextual knowledge 1–18 .
		  Consider the simple example of entering a colleague's
		  office and finding a place to sit down. On a daily basis,
		  in one's own office, the chair behind the desk is the
		  appropriate seat. In another's office, however, we easily
		  select the chair in front of the desk as being the socially
		  appropriate choice. Overcoming a habitual tendency in order
		  to coordinate behavior with an abstract social rule is an
		  example of cognitive control. From one perspective,
		  cognitive control mechanisms operate through a process of
		  biased competition, whereby maintenance of a distributed
		  neural representation of the task context (colleague's
		  office) configures processing throughout the action system
		  to bias selection of an appropriate behavior (sit in the
		  chair in front of the desk) over a competing one (sit in
		  the chair behind the desk) 8,19–21 . The frontal lobes
		  are thought to be centrally involved in coding such
		  contextual representations to provide internal control over
		  action 14,22,23 . However, the functional organization of
		  the frontal lobe remains unknown. Although it is widely
		  believed that separate frontal regions support distinct
		  forms of control, there is little evidence to date of
		  double dissociations in lateral frontal cortex and no
		  evidence in human patients 4 . Thus, a fundamental goal in
		  cognitive neuroscience is to characterize the functional
		  organization of frontal cortex that supports the control of
		  action. Control of action can involve abstract goals, such
		  as deciding whether to e-mail or call a friend, as well as
		  the concrete motor programs required to carry out these
		  abstract goals, such as selecting the appropriate sequence
		  of keystrokes to type an e-mail greeting 17,24–26 . Thus,
		  computational models of cognitive control and of complex
		  action have often included hierarchical architectures that
		  represent such actions at different levels of abstraction
		  24–27 . Consistent with the concept of hierarchically
		  arrayed levels of control, neuroima-ging studies have
		  repeatedly demonstrated differences in functional
		  activation along the rostro-caudal axis of lateral frontal
		  cortex, ranging from dorsal premotor cortex (PMd; BBrodmann
		  area 6/8) to lateral frontal polar cortex (Brodmann area
		  10), such that more anterior regions were associated with
		  progressively more abstract action control further removed
		  from the selection of a concrete motor response 28–31 .
		  Across these previous studies, abstraction has been defined
		  in different, although not necessarily mutually exclusive,
		  ways 32 . Some have sug-gested that posterior regions are
		  more sensitive to domain distinctions, such as spatial
		  versus object, whereas more anterior regions are not 18,33
		  . Others propose that progressively anterior regions
		  coordinate action over longer time scales and so can
		  maintain action representations and mediate action
		  contingencies over longer temporal gaps 7,34 . Still others
		  have proposed that progressively anterior regions maintain
		  more complex rules that choose a class of more specific,
		  lower-level rules; the lowest being the rule that specifies
		  a motor responses 28 . For example, the choice to write an
		  e-mail is abstract relative to choices about what words to
		  put in the e-mail itself. Regardless of the specific

  abstract	= {There is limited understanding of how monoamine-producing
		  nuclei within midbrain and brainstem contribute to the
		  formation and functional dynamics of brain networks across
		  the human neocortex. We used resting state fMRI in 154
		  healthy participants to elucidate patterns of functional
		  connectivity and network organization between
		  cortical/subcortical regions and midbrain/brainstem
		  nuclei.By means of univariate functional connectivity and
		  graph-based analysis, we show that dopaminergic midbrain
		  centers and the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) are
		  functionally integrated with the default mode network
		  (DMN), whereas the remaining serotonergic raphe nuclei and
		  the noradrenergic locus coeruleus are functionally
		  integrated with the executive-control network (ECN). The
		  majority of midbrain/brainstem nuclei show a high level of
		  connectedness to other network modules classifying these
		  nuclei as "connector" hubs. The additionally applied
		  probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA) broadly
		  corresponded with the results of the GT analysis,
		  describing similar functionally-relevant cortical networks.
		  Since monoaminergic neurotransmission is essential to

  abstract	= {There is limited understanding of how monoamine-producing
		  nuclei within midbrain and brainstem contribute to the
		  formation and functional dynamics of brain networks across
		  the human neocortex. We used resting state fMRI in 154
		  healthy participants to elucidate patterns of functional
		  connectivity and network organization between
		  cortical/subcortical regions and midbrain/brainstem
		  nuclei.By means of univariate functional connectivity and
		  graph-based analysis, we show that dopaminergic midbrain
		  centers and the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) are
		  functionally integrated with the default mode network
		  (DMN), whereas the remaining serotonergic raphe nuclei and
		  the noradrenergic locus coeruleus are functionally
		  integrated with the executive-control network (ECN). The
		  majority of midbrain/brainstem nuclei show a high level of
		  connectedness to other network modules classifying these
		  nuclei as "connector" hubs. The additionally applied
		  probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA) broadly
		  corresponded with the results of the GT analysis,
		  describing similar functionally-relevant cortical networks.
		  Since monoaminergic neurotransmission is essential to
		  neocortical function, and represents an important target
		  for pharmacotherapy, our novel findings contribute to a
		  comprehensive understanding of the functional organization
		  of the human brain.},

  abstract	= {Dopamine release in cortical and subcortical structures
		  plays a central role in reward-related neural processes.
		  Within this context, dopaminergic inputs are commonly
		  assumed to play an activating role, facilitating behavioral
		  and cognitive operations necessary to obtain a prospective
		  reward. Here, we provide evidence from human fMRI that this
		  activating role can also be mediated by task-demand-related
		  processes and thus extends beyond situations that only
		  entail extrinsic motivating factors. Using a visual
		  discrimination task in which varying levels of task demands
		  were precued, we found enhanced hemodynamic activity in the
		  substantia nigra (SN) for high task demands in the absence
		  of reward or similar extrinsic motivating factors. This
		  observation thus indicates that the SN can also be
		  activated in an endogenous fashion. In parallel to its role
		  in reward-related processes, reward-independent activation
		  likely serves to recruit the processing resources needed to
		  meet enhanced task demands. Simultaneously, activity in a
		  wide network of cortical and subcortical control regions
		  was enhanced in response to high task demands, whereas
		  areas of the default-mode network were deactivated more
		  strongly. The present observations suggest that the SN
		  represents a core node within a broader neural network that
		  adjusts the amount of available neural and behavioral
		  resources to changing situational opportunities and task
		  requirements, which is often driven by extrinsic factors
		  but can also be controlled endogenously.},

###Article{	  boehler2011,
  abstract	= {Dopamine release in cortical and subcortical structures
		  plays a central role in reward-related neural processes.
		  Within this context, dopaminergic inputs are commonly
		  assumed to play an activating role, facilitating behavioral
		  and cognitive operations necessary to obtain a prospective
		  reward. Here, we provide evidence from human fMRI that this
		  activating role can also be mediated by task-demand-related
		  processes and thus extends beyond situations that only
		  entail extrinsic motivating factors. Using a visual
		  discrimination task in which varying levels of task demands
		  were precued, we found enhanced hemodynamic activity in the
		  substantia nigra (SN) for high task demands in the absence
		  of reward or similar extrinsic motivating factors. This
		  observation thus indicates that the SN can also be
		  activated in an endogenous fashion. In parallel to its role
		  in reward-related processes, reward-independent activation
		  likely serves to recruit the processing resources needed to
		  meet enhanced task demands. Simultaneously, activity in a
		  wide network of cortical and subcortical control regions
		  was enhanced in response to high task demands, whereas
		  areas of the default-mode network were deactivated more
		  strongly. The present observations suggest that the SN
		  represents a core node within a broader neural network that
		  adjusts the amount of available neural and behavioral
		  resources to changing situational opportunities and task
		  requirements, which is often driven by extrinsic factors
		  but can also be controlled endogenously.},

  abstract	= {According to one influential account, the anterior
		  cingulate cortex (ACC) serves to monitor for conflicts in
		  information processing. According to another influential
		  account, the ACC monitors action outcomes and guides
		  decision making. Both of these perspectives are supported
		  by an abundance of data, making it untenable to reject one
		  view in favor of the other. Instead, the apparent challenge
		  is to discover how the two perspectives might fit together
		  within a larger account. In the present article, we
		  consider the prospects for such a reconciliation.
		  Juxtaposing the conflict-monitoring and decision-making
		  accounts suggests an extension of the conflict-monitoring
		  theory, by which conflict would act as a teaching signal
		  driving a form of avoidance learning. The effect of this
		  mechanism would be to bias behavioral decision making
		  toward cognitively efficient tasks and strategies. We
		  discuss evidence favoring this proposal and present an
		  initial computational model, which lays the foundation for
		  further development.},

  abstract	= {Cognitive control requires a fine balance between
		  stability, the protection of an on-going task-set, and
		  flexibility, the ability to update a task-set in line with
		  changing contingencies. It is thought that emotional
		  processing modulates this balance, but results have been
		  equivocal regarding the direction of this modulation. Here,
		  we tested the hypothesis that a crucial determinant of this
		  modulation is whether affective stimuli represent
		  performance-contingent or task-irrelevant signals.
		  Combining functional magnetic resonance imag- ing with a
		  conflict task-switching paradigm, we contrasted the effects
		  of presenting negative- and positive-valence pictures on
		  the stability/flexibility trade-off in humans, depending on
		  whether picture presentation was contingent on behavioral
		  performance. Both the behavioral and neural expressions of
		  cognitive control were modulated by stimulus valence and
		  performance contingency: in the performance-contingent
		  condition, cognitive flexibility was enhanced following
		  positive pictures, whereas in the nonperformance-
		  contingent condition, positive stimuli promoted cognitive
		  stability. The imaging data showed that, as anticipated,
		  the stability/flexibility trade-off per se was reflected in
		  differential recruitment of dorsolateral frontoparietal and
		  striatal regions. In contrast, the affective modulation of
		  stability/flexibility shifts was mirrored, unexpectedly, by
		  neural responses in ventromedial prefrontal and posterior
		  cingulate cortices, core nodes of the “default mode”
		  network. Our results demonstrate that the affective
		  modulation of cognitive control depends on the performance
		  contingency of the affect-inducing stimuli, and they
		  document medial default mode regions to mediate the
		  flexibility-promoting effects of performance-contingent
		  positive affect, thus extending recent work that recasts
		  these regions as serving a key role in on-task control
		  processes},

  abstract	= {Cognitive control requires a fine balance between
		  stability, the protection of an on-going task-set, and
		  flexibility, the ability to update a task-set in line with
		  changing contingencies. It is thought that emotional
		  processing modulates this balance, but results have been
		  equivocal regarding the direction of this modulation. Here,
		  we tested the hypothesis that a crucial determinant of this
		  modulation is whether affective stimuli represent
		  performance-contingent or task-irrelevant signals.
		  Combining functional magnetic resonance imag- ing with a
		  conflict task-switching paradigm, we contrasted the effects
		  of presenting negative- and positive-valence pictures on
		  the stability/flexibility trade-off in humans, depending on
		  whether picture presentation was contingent on behavioral
		  performance. Both the behavioral and neural expressions of
		  cognitive control were modulated by stimulus valence and
		  performance contingency: in the performance-contingent
		  condition, cognitive flexibility was enhanced following
		  positive pictures, whereas in the nonperformance-
		  contingent condition, positive stimuli promoted cognitive
		  stability. The imaging data showed that, as anticipated,
		  the stability/flexibility trade-off per se was reflected in
		  differential recruitment of dorsolateral frontoparietal and
		  striatal regions. In contrast, the affective modulation of
		  stability/flexibility shifts was mirrored, unexpectedly, by
		  neural responses in ventromedial prefrontal and posterior
		  cingulate cortices, core nodes of the “default mode”
		  network. Our results demonstrate that the affective
		  modulation of cognitive control depends on the performance
		  contingency of the affect-inducing stimuli, and they
		  document medial default mode regions to mediate the
		  flexibility-promoting effects of performance-contingent
		  positive affect, thus extending recent work that recasts
		  these regions as serving a key role in on-task control
		  processes},

  abstract	= {Certain organizational features of brain networks present
		  in the individual are lost when central tendencies are
		  examined in the group. Here we investigated the detailed
		  network organization of four individuals each scanned 24
		  times using MRI. We discovered that the distributed network
		  known as the default network is comprised of two separate
		  networks possessing adjacent regions in eight or more
		  cortical zones. A distinction between the networks is that
		  one is coupled to the hippocampal formation while the other
		  is not. Further exploration revealed that these two
		  networks were juxtaposed with additional networks that
		  themselves fractionate group-defined networks. The
		  collective networks display a repeating spatial progression
		  in multiple cortical zones, suggesting that they are
		  embedded within a broad macroscale gradient. Regions
		  contributing to the newly defined networks are spatially
		  variable across individuals and adjacent to distinct
		  networks, raising issues for network estimation in
		  group-averaged data and applied endeavors, including
		  targeted neuromodulation. Braga and Buckner examine the

		  A new theory hypotheses: p.719 1) Context representations
		  are actively maintained ina gated attractor system within
		  PFC
		  
		  2) phasic changes in DA activity serve two functions: a) to
		  gate information in active memory in PFC b) to strengthen
		  associations between stimuli that predict reward and the DA
		  response
		  
		  3) Both effects rely on a similar neuromodulatory mechanism
		  
		  4) the gating effect occurs through the transient
		  potentiation of both excitatory afferent and local
		  inhibitory effects in PFC
		  
		  5) The learning effect occurs through modualtion of
		  synaptic weights, driven by errors between predicted and
		  received rewards (the TD algorithm)
		  
		  6) The coincidence of the gating and learning signals
		  produces cortical associations between the information
		  being gated and a triggering of the gating signal in the

		  from which to review and evaluate the recent literature on
		  working memory and executive control in adults. Critically,
		  we will aim to determine the extent to which this growing
		  literature can be integrated under the goal maintenance
		  account. In the final section, we discuss emerging trends
		  and future research directions that may provide a better
		  test of the theory, or point to ways in which it should be
		  extended or refined. Before describing the goal maintenance
		  theory, we begin by discussing first the historical trends
		  and research approaches prominent in cognitive aging
		  studies of working memory and executive control. (PsycINFO

  abstract	= {Higher cardiorespiratory fitness has been associated with
		  better cognitive function in older adults; yet, this
		  relationship demonstrates a degree of variability across
		  the older adult population. Thus, it is hypothesised that
		  variation in genetic factors may influence the relationship
		  between fitness and cognitive health. One such genetic
		  factor is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
		  Val66Met polymorphism, which has previously been shown to
		  moderate the relationship between self-reported physical
		  activity and memory performance. In this study we aim to
		  investigate the interaction between BDNF Val66Met
		  polymorphism and objectively-measured cardiorespiratory
		  fitness on performance on tasks assessing verbal and
		  visuospatial memory. Data from ninety-nine cognitively
		  normal men and women aged 60–80 years were used. Fitness
		  was assessed by peak oxygen consumption, and verbal and
		  visuospatial memory were evaluated using well-validated
		  measures. Participants were categorised into: lower-fit Met
		  carriers, higher-fit Met carriers, lower-fit Val/Val, or
		  higher-fit Val/Val. Higher-fit individuals performed better
		  on a task assessing visuospatial memory, compared with
		  lower-fit individuals. Furthermore, an interaction between
		  BDNF Val66Met and fitness was observed in terms of
		  visuospatial memory performance on a continuous paired
		  associate learning task; whereby lower-fit Met carriers
		  performed 1 standard deviation worse than higher-fit Met
		  carriers. No differences were observed between the
		  higher-fit and lower-fit Val/Val homozygotes. Future
		  intervention studies should evaluate the effect of
		  structured exercise on cognitive health between BDNF
		  Val66Met carriers and Val/Val homozygotes.},

		  that gap. In Experiment 1, older adults, like young adults,
		  showed less interference for mostly incongruent items than
		  mostly congruent items in a picture-word Stroop task, and
		  this pattern extended to novel, 50{\%} congruent transfer
		  items. In Experiment 2, flanker stimuli in one screen
		  location (or color) were mostly congruent whereas flanker
		  stimuli in a second location (or color) were mostly
		  incongruent. Young and older adults demonstrated
		  context-specific proportion congruence effects, showing
		  less interference in the mostly incongruent as compared to
		  mostly congruent context for the location cue but not the
		  color cue. These findings provide converging evidence for
		  the intact and flexible use of reactive control with age,
		  and challenge the view that aging is associated with a
		  general deficit in cognitive control.},

  abstract	= {Cognitive ageing research examines the cognitive abilities
		  that are preserved and/or those that decline with advanced
		  age. There is great individual variability in cognitive
		  ageing trajectories. Some older adults show little decline
		  in cognitive ability compared with young adults and are
		  thus termed ‘optimally ageing'. By contrast, others
		  exhibit substantial cognitive decline and may develop
		  dementia. Human neuroimaging research has led to a number
		  of important advances in our understanding of the neural
		  mechanisms underlying these two outcomes. However,
		  interpreting the age-related changes and differences in
		  brain structure, activation and functional connectivity
		  that this research reveals is an ongoing challenge.
		  Ambiguous terminology is a major source of difficulty in
		  this venture. Three terms in particular — compensation,
		  maintenance and reserve — have been used in a number of
		  different ways, and researchers continue to disagree about
		  the kinds of evidence or patterns of results that are
		  required to interpret findings related to these concepts.
		  As such inconsistencies can impede progress in both
		  theoretical and empirical research, here, we aim to clarify
		  and propose consensual definitions of these terms.},
  annote	= {compensation maintenance: supports the replenishment and
		  repair the neural resources reserve: supports the creation
		  of neural resources that help withstand the neural decline
		  
		  neural resources: brain anatomy and physiology that mediate
		  cognitive processes (e.g. grey matter volume or white
		  matter integrity, function of a region, or a region's
		  relationship to a network)
		  
		  Definitions: reserve - a cumulative improvement, due to
		  genetic and/or environmental factors, of neural resources
		  that mitigates the effects of neural decline caused by
		  aging or age-related diseases.
		  
		  maintenance: the preservation of neural resources, which
		  entails ongoing repair and replenishment of the brain in
		  response to damage incurred at the cellular and molecular
		  levels owing to "wear and tear".
		  
		  how well we display maintenance depends on the amount of
		  damage and the ability for repair.
		  
		  reserve + maintenance both involve enhancing current
		  resources: reserve augments resources beyond current levels
		  maintenance is about returning resources to their former
		  higher level
		  
		  compensation: refers to the cognition-enhancing recruitment
		  of neural resources in response to relatively high
		  cognitive demand
		  
		  upregulation - boosting a neural process in response to
		  task demands
		  
		  selection - using a less effective but less demanding
		  process that younger adults have access to, but prefer to
		  use a more effective/more demanding process

		  change that took place between two occasions. In this
		  article, the authors pose a motivating example in which a

		  on pre-to post-marriage change in relationship
		  satisfaction. Key features of this example include the
		  likely self-selection of dyads with lower relationship
		  satisfaction to cohabit and the impossibility of using
		  experimentation procedures to attain equivalent groups
		  (i.e., cohabitants vs. not cohabitants). The authors use
		  this example of a nonrandomized study to compare the
		  residualized change and difference score models
		  analytically and empirically. The authors describe the
		  assumptions of the models to explain Lord's paradox; that
		  is, the fact that these models can lead to different

		  5 days per week, for 9 months, showed decreases in fMRI
		  brain activation in the right anterior prefrontal cortex
		  coupled with within-group improvements in performance on a
		  task of attentional and interference control. Children
		  assigned to a wait-list control group did not show changes
		  in brain function. Furthermore, at post-test, children in
		  the physical activity group showed similar anterior frontal
		  brain patterns and incongruent accuracy rates to a group of
		  college-aged young adults. Children in the wait-list
		  control group still differed from the young adults in terms
		  of anterior prefrontal activation and performance at
		  post-test. There were no significant changes in fMRI
		  activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for
		  either group. These results suggest that physical activity
		  during childhood may enhance specific elements of
		  prefrontal cortex function involved in cognitive control.},

  abstract	= {Many cognitive and clinical neuroscience research studies
		  seek to determine how contextual factors modulate cognitive
		  processes. In fMRI, hypotheses about how context modulates
		  distributed patterns of information processing are often
		  tested by comparing functional connectivity between neural
		  regions A and B as a function of task conditions X and Y,
		  which is termed context-modulated functional connectivity
		  (FC). There exist two exploratory statistical approaches to
		  testing context-modulated FC: the beta-series method and
		  psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis methods.
		  While these approaches are commonly used, their relative
		  power for detecting context-modulated FC is unknown,
		  especially with respect to real-world experimental
		  parameters (e.g., number of stimulus repetitions,
		  inter-trial-interval, stimulus duration). Here, we use
		  simulations to compare power for detecting
		  context-modulated FC between the standard PPI formulation
		  (sPPI), generalized PPI formulation (gPPI), and beta series
		  methods. Simulation results demonstrate that gPPI and beta
		  series methods are generally more powerful than sPPI.
		  Whether gPPI or beta series methods performed more
		  powerfully depended on experiment parameters: block designs
		  favor the gPPI, whereas the beta series method was more
		  powerful for designs with more trial repetitions and it
		  also retained more power under conditions of hemodynamic
		  response function variability. On a real dataset of
		  adolescent girls, the PPI methods appeared to have greater
		  sensitivity in detecting task-modulated FC when using a
		  block design and the beta series method appeared to have
		  greater sensitivity when using an event-related design with
		  many trial repetitions. Implications of these performance
		  results are discussed.},

  abstract	= {The medial forebrain bundle (MFB), a key structure of
		  reward-seeking circuitry, remains inadequately
		  characterized in humans despite its vast importance for
		  emotional processing and development of addictions and
		  depression. Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging Fiber Tracking
		  (DTI FT) the authors describe potential converging
		  ascending and descending MFB and anterior thalamic
		  radiation (ATR) that may mediate major brain reward-seeking
		  and punishment functions. Authors highlight novel
		  connectivity, such as supero-lateral-branch MFB and ATR
		  convergence, caudally as well as rostrally, in the anterior
		  limb of the internal capsule and medial prefrontal cortex.
		  These anatomical convergences may sustain a dynamic
		  equilibrium between positive and negative affective states
		  in human mood-regulation and its various disorders,
		  especially evident in addictions and depression.},

		  Using recent advances in characterizing brain network

		  were consistent across practiced and novel tasks,
		  suggesting that reuse of flexible hub connectivity patterns

  abstract	= {Extensive evidence suggests that the human ability to
		  adaptively implement a wide variety of tasks is
		  preferentially a result of the operation of a
		  fronto-parietal brain network (FPN). We hypothesized that
		  this network's adaptability is made possible by flexible
		  hubs: brain regions that rapidly update their pattern of
		  global functional connectivity according to task demands.
		  Using recent advances in characterizing brain network
		  organization and dynamics, we identified mechanisms
		  consistent with the flexible hub theory. We found that the
		  FPN's brain-wide functional connectivity pattern shifted
		  more than those of other networks across a variety of task
		  states and that these connectivity patterns could be used
		  to identify the current task. Furthermore, these patterns
		  were consistent across practiced and novel tasks,
		  suggesting that reuse of flexible hub connectivity patterns
		  facilitates adaptive (novel) task performance. Together,
		  these findings support a central role for fronto-parietal
		  flexible hubs in cognitive control and adaptive
		  implementation of task demands},

  abstract	= {Most neuroscientific studies have focused on task-evoked
		  activations (activity amplitudes at specific brain
		  locations), providing limited insight into the functional
		  relationships between separate brain locations. Task-state
		  functional connectivity (FC) – statistical association
		  between brain activity time series during task performance
		  – moves beyond task-evoked activations by quantifying
		  functional interactions during tasks. However, many
		  task-state FC studies do not remove the first-order effect
		  of task-evoked activations prior to estimating task-state
		  FC. It has been argued that this results in the ambiguous
		  inference “likely active or interacting during the
		  task” rather than the intended inference “likely
		  interacting during the task”. Utilizing a neural mass
		  computational model, we verified that task-evoked
		  activations substantially and inappropriately inflate
		  task-state FC estimates, especially in functional MRI
		  (fMRI) data. Various methods attempting to address this
		  problem have been developed, yet the efficacies of these
		  approaches have not been systematically assessed. We found
		  that most standard approaches for fitting and removing mean
		  task-evoked activations were unable to correct these
		  inflated correlations. In contrast, methods that flexibly
		  fit mean task-evoked response shapes effectively corrected
		  the inflated correlations without reducing effects of
		  interest. Results with empirical fMRI data confirmed the
		  model's predictions, revealing activation-induced
		  task-state FC inflation for both Pearson correlation and
		  psychophysiological interaction (PPI) approaches. These
		  results demonstrate that removal of mean task-evoked
		  activations using an approach that flexibly models
		  task-evoked response shape is an important preprocessing
		  step for valid estimation of task-state FC.},

		  Among the neuronal populations most af-fected by aging,
		  dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta
		  are of particular interest. These neurons project to the
		  dorsal striatum where their patterns of dopamine release
		  are essential for voli-tional motor control and several
		  cognitive functions (Paladini and Roeper, 2014). Pre-vious
		  studies have shown that nigral dopa-mine neurons are
		  progressively lost during normal aging (Gibb and Lees,
		  1991), which likely contributes to age-related functional
		  deficits. Moreover, old age is the major risk factor for
		  Parkinson's disease, which is char-acterized by a tenfold
		  accelerated loss of nigral dopamine neurons (Gibb and Lees,
		  1991). A key question is whether functional
		  changesinsurvivingoldnigraldopamineneu-rons also contribute

		  Journal of Neuroscience, Branch and col-leagues (2014) made
		  a substantial contri-bution by investigating how age

		  spontaneous pace-maker firing generated by intrinsic ionic
		  currents. Using extracellular cell-attached recordings,
		  Branch and colleagues (2014) discovered that nigral
		  dopamine neurons from old mice had significantly lower
		  spontaneous firing rates, shorter spike widths, and lower
		  pacemaker precision (i.e., higher variability in interspike
		  inter-val) than neurons from young adult (2–7 months)
		  counterparts. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed
		  that the input resistance and capacitance of old and young
		  neurons were similar, indicating that the observed slower
		  firing was unre-lated to changes in resting membrane
		  conductances or gross morphology. The authors next used
		  biophysical and pharmacological approaches to identify the
		  relevant changes in ion channels that caused the
		  age-related change in firing. Surprisingly, they found that
		  several key channels that control dopamine neuron pacemaker
		  rate and precision, including hyperpolarization-activated
		  cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels and small
		  conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels

  abstract	= {Many theories of decision making assume that choice
		  options are assessed along a common subjective value (SV)
		  scale. The neural correlates of SV are widespread and
		  reliable, despite the wide variation in the range of values
		  over which decisions are made (e.g., between goods worth a
		  few dollars, in some cases, or hundreds of dollars, in
		  others). According to adaptive coding theories (Barlow,
		  1961), an efficient value signal should exhibit range
		  adaptation, such that neural activity maintains a fixed
		  dynamic range, and the slope of the value response varies
		  inversely with the range of values within the local
		  context. Although monkey data have demonstrated range
		  adaptation in single-unit correlates of value
		  (Padoa-Schioppa, 2009; Kobayashi et al., 2010), whether
		  BOLD value signals exhibit similar range adaptation is
		  unknown. To test for this possibility, we presented human
		  participants with choices between a fixed immediate and
		  variable delayed payment options. Across two conditions,
		  the delayed options' SVs spanned either a narrow or wide
		  range. SV-tracking activity emerged in the posterior
		  cingulate, ventral striatum, anterior cingulate, and
		  ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Throughout this network, we
		  observed evidence consistent with the predictions of range
		  adaptation: the SV response slope increased in the narrow
		  versus wide range, with statistically significant slope
		  changes confirmed for the posterior cingulate and ventral
		  striatum. No regions exhibited a reliably increased BOLD
		  activity range in the wide versus narrow condition. Our
		  observations of range adaptation present implications for
		  the interpretation of BOLD SV responses that are measured
		  across different contexts or individuals.},

		  expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E.
		  coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was
		  deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli,
		  and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed
		  the substrate range already reported, with important
		  differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all
		  $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in
		  deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump
		  genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with
		  AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems
		  pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less
		  effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic
		  $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although
		  it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was
		  remarkably more effective than a similar level of
		  AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin,
		  and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux
		  of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare
		  these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can
		  assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional
		  in the E. coli host.},

		  specific fiber tracts traversing frontal and parietal, but
		  not temporal cortex. This pattern inverts the sequence of
		  myelination during childhood and early development observed
		  in previous studies and lends support to a
		  "last-in-first-out" theory of the white matter health
		  across the lifespan. Second, both the effects of aging on
		  white matter and their impact on cognitive performance were
		  stronger for radial diffusivity (RD) than for axial
		  diffusivity (AD). Given that RD has previously been shown
		  to be more sensitive to myelin integrity than AD, this
		  second finding is also consistent with the
		  myelodegeneration hypothesis. Finally, the effects of aging
		  on select white matter tracts were associated with age
		  difference in specific cognitive functions. Specifically,
		  FA in anterior tracts was shown to be primarily associated
		  with executive tasks and FA in posterior tracts mainly
		  associated with visual memory tasks. Furthermore, these
		  correlations were mirrored in RD, but not AD, suggesting
		  that RD is more sensitive to age-related changes in
		  cognition. Taken together, the results help to clarify how
		  age-related white matter decline impairs cognitive
		  performance.},

  abstract	= {Human brain anatomical and resting-state functional
		  connectivity have been comprehensively portrayed using MRI,
		  which are termed anatomical and functional connectomes. A
		  systematic examination of tasks modulated whole brain
		  functional connectivity, which we term as task connectome,
		  is still lacking. We analyzed 6 block-designed and 1
		  event-related designed functional MRI data, and examined
		  whole-brain task modulated connectivity in various task
		  domains, including emotion, reward, language, relation,
		  social cognition, working memory, and inhibition. By using
		  psychophysiological interaction between pairs of regions
		  from the whole brain, we identified statistically
		  significant task modulated connectivity in 4 tasks between
		  their experimental and respective control conditions. Task
		  modulated connectivity was found not only between regions
		  that were activated during the task but also regions that
		  were not activated or deactivated, suggesting a broader
		  involvement of brain regions in a task than indicated by
		  simple regional activations. Decreased functional
		  connectivity was observed in all the 4 tasks and sometimes
		  reduced connectivity was even between regions that were
		  both activated during the task. This suggests that brain
		  regions that are activated together do not necessarily work
		  together. The current study demonstrates the comprehensive
		  task connectomes of 4 tasks, and suggested complex
		  relationships between regional activations and connectivity
		  changes.},

  abstract	= { Accurately making a decision in the face of incongruent
		  options increases the efficiency of making similar
		  congruency decisions in the future. Contextual factors like
		  reward can modulate this adaptive process, suggesting that
		  networks associated with monitoring previous success and
		  failure outcomes might contribute to this form of
		  behavioral updating. To evaluate this possibility, a group
		  of healthy adults (n = 30) were tested with functional MRI
		  (fMRI) while they performed a color-word Stroop task. In a
		  conflict-related region of the medial orbitofrontal cortex
		  (mOFC), stronger BOLD responses predicted faster response
		  times (RTs) on the next trial. More importantly, the degree
		  of behavioral adaptation of RTs was correlated with the
		  magnitude of mOFC-RT associations on the previous trial,
		  but only after accounting for network-level interactions
		  with prefrontal and striatal regions. This suggests that
		  congruency sequencing effects may rely on interactions
		  between distributed corticostriatal circuits. This
		  possibility was evaluated by measuring the convergence of
		  white matter projections from frontal areas into the
		  striatum with diffusion-weighted imaging. In these
		  pathways, greater convergence of corticostriatal
		  projections correlated with stronger functional mOFC-RT
		  associations that, in turn, provided an indirect pathway
		  linking anatomical structure to behavior. Thus distributed
		  corticostriatal processing may mediate the orbitofrontal
		  cortex's influence on behavioral updating, even in the
		  absence of explicit rewards. },

		  are needed for developing therapeutic interventions.
		  Measures of attentional control in Stroop-type tasks
		  discriminate healthy aging from early stage AD and predict
		  future development of AD in cognitively normal individuals.
		  Disruption in resting state functional connectivity MRI
		  (rs-fcMRI) has been reported in AD and in healthy controls
		  at risk for AD. We explored the relationship among Stroop
		  performance, rs-fcMRI, and CSF A$\beta$₄₂ levels in
		  cognitively normal older
		  adults.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: A computerized
		  Stroop task (along with standard neuropsychological
		  measures), rs-fcMRI, and CSF were obtained in 237
		  cognitively normal older adults. We compared the
		  relationship between Stroop performance, including measures
		  from reaction distributional analyses, and composite scores
		  from four resting state networks (RSNs; default mode [DMN],
		  salience [SAL], dorsal attention [DAN], and sensory-motor
		  [SMN]), and the modulatory influence of CSF A$\beta$₄₂
		  levels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A larger Stroop
		  effect in errors was associated with reduced rs-fcMRI
		  within the DMN and SAL. Reaction time (RT) distributional
		  analyses indicated the slow tail of the RT distribution was
		  related to reduced rs-fcMRI functional connectivity within
		  the SAL. Standard psychometric measures were not related to
		  RSN composite scores. A relationship between Stroop
		  performance and DMN (but not SAL) functional connectivity
		  was stronger in CSF A$\beta$₄₂-positive
		  individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A link
		  exists between RSN composite scores and specific
		  attentional performance measures. Both measures may be
		  sensitive biomarkers for AD.},

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVE: Early biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
		  are needed for developing therapeutic interventions.
		  Measures of attentional control in Stroop-type tasks
		  discriminate healthy aging from early stage AD and predict
		  future development of AD in cognitively normal individuals.
		  Disruption in resting state functional connectivity MRI
		  (rs-fcMRI) has been reported in AD and in healthy controls
		  at risk for AD. We explored the relationship among Stroop
		  performance, rs-fcMRI, and CSF A$\beta$₄₂ levels in
		  cognitively normal older
		  adults.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: A computerized
		  Stroop task (along with standard neuropsychological
		  measures), rs-fcMRI, and CSF were obtained in 237
		  cognitively normal older adults. We compared the
		  relationship between Stroop performance, including measures
		  from reaction distributional analyses, and composite scores
		  from four resting state networks (RSNs; default mode [DMN],
		  salience [SAL], dorsal attention [DAN], and sensory-motor
		  [SMN]), and the modulatory influence of CSF A$\beta$₄₂
		  levels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A larger Stroop
		  effect in errors was associated with reduced rs-fcMRI
		  within the DMN and SAL. Reaction time (RT) distributional
		  analyses indicated the slow tail of the RT distribution was
		  related to reduced rs-fcMRI functional connectivity within
		  the SAL. Standard psychometric measures were not related to
		  RSN composite scores. A relationship between Stroop
		  performance and DMN (but not SAL) functional connectivity
		  was stronger in CSF A$\beta$₄₂-positive
		  individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A link
		  exists between RSN composite scores and specific
		  attentional performance measures. Both measures may be
		  sensitive biomarkers for AD.},

		  understand how to reliably evaluate and optimally use these
		  methods. Simulations of fMRI data can aid in both the
		  evaluation of complex designs and the analysis of data. New
		  Method: We present fmrisim, a new Python package for
		  standardized, realistic simulation of fMRI data. This
		  package is part of BrainIAK: a recently released
		  open-source Python toolbox for advanced neuroimaging
		  analyses. We describe how to use fmrisim to extract noise
		  properties from real fMRI data and then create a synthetic
		  dataset with matched noise properties and a user-specified
		  signal. Results: We validate the noise generated by fmrisim
		  to show that it can approximate the noise properties of
		  real data. We further show how fmrisim can help researchers
		  find the optimal design in terms of power. Comparison with
		  other methods: fmrisim ports the functionality of other
		  packages to the Python platform while extending what is
		  available in order to make it seamless to simulate
		  realistic fMRI data. Conclusions: The fmrisim package holds

  abstract	= {Midbrain dopamine neurons signal reward value, their
		  prediction error, and the salience of events. If they play
		  a critical role in achieving specific distant goals,
		  long-term future rewards should also be encoded as
		  suggested in reinforcement learning theories. Here, we
		  address this experimentally untested issue. We recorded 185
		  dopamine neurons in three monkeys that performed a
		  multistep choice task in which they explored a reward
		  target among alternatives and then exploited that knowledge
		  to receive one or two additional rewards by choosing the
		  same target in a set of subsequent trials. An analysis of
		  anticipatory licking for reward water indicated that the
		  monkeys did not anticipate an immediately expected reward
		  in individual trials; rather, they anticipated the sum of
		  immediate and multiple future rewards. In accordance with
		  this behavioral observation, the dopamine responses to the
		  start cues and reinforcer beeps reflected the expected
		  values of the multiple future rewards and their errors,
		  respectively. More specifically, when monkeys learned the
		  multistep choice task over the course of several weeks, the
		  responses of dopamine neurons encoded the sum of the
		  immediate and expected multiple future rewards. The
		  dopamine responses were quantitatively predicted by
		  theoretical descriptions of the value function with time
		  discounting in reinforcement learning. These findings
		  demonstrate that dopamine neurons learn to encode the
		  long-term value of multiple future rewards with distant

  abstract	= {Midbrain dopamine neurons signal reward value, their
		  prediction error, and the salience of events. If they play
		  a critical role in achieving specific distant goals,
		  long-term future rewards should also be encoded as
		  suggested in reinforcement learning theories. Here, we
		  address this experimentally untested issue. We recorded 185
		  dopamine neurons in three monkeys that performed a
		  multistep choice task in which they explored a reward
		  target among alternatives and then exploited that knowledge
		  to receive one or two additional rewards by choosing the
		  same target in a set of subsequent trials. An analysis of
		  anticipatory licking for reward water indicated that the
		  monkeys did not anticipate an immediately expected reward
		  in individual trials; rather, they anticipated the sum of
		  immediate and multiple future rewards. In accordance with
		  this behavioral observation, the dopamine responses to the
		  start cues and reinforcer beeps reflected the expected
		  values of the multiple future rewards and their errors,
		  respectively. More specifically, when monkeys learned the
		  multistep choice task over the course of several weeks, the
		  responses of dopamine neurons encoded the sum of the
		  immediate and expected multiple future rewards. The
		  dopamine responses were quantitatively predicted by
		  theoretical descriptions of the value function with time
		  discounting in reinforcement learning. These findings
		  demonstrate that dopamine neurons learn to encode the
		  long-term value of multiple future rewards with distant
		  rewards discounted.},

		  decline there is an absence of effective approaches for
		  improving neurocognitive health. Fortunately, moderate
		  intensity exercise is a promising method for improving
		  brain and cognitive health in late life, but its
		  effectiveness remains a matter of skepticism and debate
		  because of the absence of large, comprehensive, Phase III
		  clinical trials. Here we describe the protocol for such a
		  randomized clinical trial called IGNITE (Investigating
		  Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of
		  Exercise), a study capable of more definitively addressing
		  whether exercise influences cognitive and brain health in
		  cognitively normal older adults. We are conducting a
		  12-month, multi-site, randomized dose-response exercise
		  trial in 639 cognitively normal adults between 65 and 80
		  years of age. Participants are randomized to (1) a moderate
		  intensity aerobic exercise condition of 150 min/week (N =

		  at 225 min/week (N = 213), or (3) a light intensity

		  Differences between 2 target-alone control conditions, one
		  presented intermixed with noise-condition trials and one
		  presented separately in blocks, gave evidence of a
		  preparatory set on the part of Ss to inhibit responses to
		  the noise letters. It is concluded that S could not prevent

		  the target due to the nature of processing channel capacity
		  and had to inhibit his response until he was able to

  abstract	= {The micro-architecture of the substantia nigra was studied
		  in control cases of varying age and patients with
		  parkinsonism. A single 7 mu section stained with
		  haematoxylin and eosin was examined at a specific level
		  within the caudal nigra using strict criteria. The pars
		  compacta was divided into a ventral and a dorsal tier, and
		  each tier was further subdivided into 3 regions. In 36
		  control cases there was a linear fallout of pigmented
		  neurons with advancing age in the pars compacta of the
		  caudal substantia nigra at a rate of 4.7{\%} per decade.
		  Regionally, the lateral ventral tier was relatively spared
		  (2.1{\%} loss per decade) compared with the medial ventral
		  tier (5.4{\%}) and the dorsal tier (6.9{\%}). In 20
		  Parkinson's disease (PD) cases of varying disease duration
		  there was an exponential loss of pigmented neurons with a
		  45{\%} loss in the first decade. Regionally, the pattern
		  was opposite to ageing. Loss was greatest in the lateral
		  ventral tier (average loss 91{\%}) followed by the medial
		  ventral tier (71{\%}) and the dorsal tier (56{\%}). The
		  presymptomatic phase of PD from the onset of neuronal loss
		  was estimated to be about 5 yrs. This phase is represented
		  by incidental Lewy body cases: individuals who die without
		  clinical signs of PD or dementia, but who are found to have
		  Lewy bodies at post-mortem. In 7 cases cell loss was
		  confined to the lateral ventral tier (average loss 52{\%})
		  congruent with the lateral ventral selectivity of
		  symptomatic PD. It was calculated that at the onset of
		  symptoms there was a 68{\%} cell loss in the lateral
		  ventral tier and a 48{\%} loss in the caudal nigra as a
		  whole. The regional selectivity of PD is relatively
		  specific. In 15 cases of striatonigral degeneration the
		  distribution of cell loss was similar, but the loss in the
		  dorsal tier was greater than PD by 21{\%}. In 14 cases of
		  Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome (SRO) there was no
		  predilection for the lateral ventral tier, but a tendency
		  to involve the medial nigra and spare the lateral. These
		  findings suggest that age-related attrition of pigmented
		  nigral cells is not an important factor in the pathogenesis of PD.},

  abstract	= {The micro-architecture of the substantia nigra was studied
		  in control cases of varying age and patients with
		  parkinsonism. A single 7 mu section stained with
		  haematoxylin and eosin was examined at a specific level
		  within the caudal nigra using strict criteria. The pars
		  compacta was divided into a ventral and a dorsal tier, and
		  each tier was further subdivided into 3 regions. In 36
		  control cases there was a linear fallout of pigmented
		  neurons with advancing age in the pars compacta of the
		  caudal substantia nigra at a rate of 4.7{\%} per decade.
		  Regionally, the lateral ventral tier was relatively spared
		  (2.1{\%} loss per decade) compared with the medial ventral
		  tier (5.4{\%}) and the dorsal tier (6.9{\%}). In 20
		  Parkinson's disease (PD) cases of varying disease duration
		  there was an exponential loss of pigmented neurons with a
		  45{\%} loss in the first decade. Regionally, the pattern
		  was opposite to ageing. Loss was greatest in the lateral
		  ventral tier (average loss 91{\%}) followed by the medial
		  ventral tier (71{\%}) and the dorsal tier (56{\%}). The
		  presymptomatic phase of PD from the onset of neuronal loss
		  was estimated to be about 5 yrs. This phase is represented
		  by incidental Lewy body cases: individuals who die without
		  clinical signs of PD or dementia, but who are found to have
		  Lewy bodies at post-mortem. In 7 cases cell loss was
		  confined to the lateral ventral tier (average loss 52{\%})
		  congruent with the lateral ventral selectivity of
		  symptomatic PD. It was calculated that at the onset of
		  symptoms there was a 68{\%} cell loss in the lateral
		  ventral tier and a 48{\%} loss in the caudal nigra as a
		  whole. The regional selectivity of PD is relatively
		  specific. In 15 cases of striatonigral degeneration the
		  distribution of cell loss was similar, but the loss in the
		  dorsal tier was greater than PD by 21{\%}. In 14 cases of
		  Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome (SRO) there was no
		  predilection for the lateral ventral tier, but a tendency
		  to involve the medial nigra and spare the lateral. These
		  findings suggest that age-related attrition of pigmented
		  nigral cells is not an important factor in the pathogenesis of PD.},

  abstract	= {RATIONALE: Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the
		  prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to play an essential role
		  in mediating executive functions such as the working
		  memory. DA exerts these effects by acting on D1 receptors
		  because blockade or stimulation of these receptors in the
		  PFC can impair performance on delayed response tasks.
		  However, comparatively less is known about dopaminergic
		  mechanisms that mediate other executive functions regulated
		  by the PFC. Furthermore, the functional importance of other
		  DA receptor subtypes that reside on PFC neurons (D2 and D4)
		  is unclear. OBJECTIVES: This review will summarize previous
		  findings and previously unpublished data addressing the
		  contribution of PFC DA to higher-order cognition. We will
		  compare the DA receptor mechanisms, which regulate
		  executive functions such as working memory, behavioral
		  flexibility, and decision-making. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:
		  Whereas PFC D1 receptor activity is of primary importance
		  in working memory, D1 and D2 receptors act in a cooperative
		  manner to facilitate behavioral flexibility. We note that
		  the principle of the "inverted U-shaped" function of D1
		  receptor activity mediating working memory does not
		  necessarily apply to other PFC functions. DA in different
		  subregions of the PFC also mediates decision-making
		  assessed with delay discounting or effort-based procedures,
		  and we report that D1, D2, and D4 receptors in the medial
		  PFC contribute to decision-making when animals must bias
		  the direction of behavior to avoid aversive stimuli,
		  assessed with a conditioned punishment procedure. Thus,
		  mesocortical DA modulation of distinct executive functions
		  is subserved by dissociable profiles of DA receptor
		  activity in the PFC.},

		  However, comparatively less is known about dopaminergic
		  mechanisms that mediate other executive functions regulated
		  by the PFC. Furthermore, the functional importance of other
		  DA receptor subtypes that reside on PFC neurons (D2 and D4)
		  is unclear. OBJECTIVES: This review will summarize previous
		  findings and previously unpublished data addressing the
		  contribution of PFC DA to higher-order cognition. We will
		  compare the DA receptor mechanisms, which regulate
		  executive functions such as working memory, behavioral
		  flexibility, and decision-making. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:
		  Whereas PFC D1 receptor activity is of primary importance
		  in working memory, D1 and D2 receptors act in a cooperative
		  manner to facilitate behavioral flexibility. We note that
		  the principle of the "inverted U-shaped" function of D1
		  receptor activity mediating working memory does not
		  necessarily apply to other PFC functions. DA in different
		  subregions of the PFC also mediates decision-making
		  assessed with delay discounting or effort-based procedures,
		  and we report that D1, D2, and D4 receptors in the medial
		  PFC contribute to decision-making when animals must bias
		  the direction of behavior to avoid aversive stimuli,
		  assessed with a conditioned punishment procedure. Thus,
		  mesocortical DA modulation of distinct executive functions
		  is subserved by dissociable profiles of DA receptor
		  activity in the PFC.},

  abstract	= {The creation of high-quality medical imaging reference
		  atlas datasets with consistent dense anatomical region
		  labels is a challenging task. Reference atlases have many
		  uses in medical image applications and are essential
		  components of atlas-based segmentation tools commonly used
		  for producing personalized anatomical measurements for
		  individual subjects. The process of manual identification
		  of anatomical regions by experts is regarded as a so-called
		  gold standard; however, it is usually impractical because
		  of the labor-intensive costs. Further, as the number of
		  regions of interest increases, these manually created
		  atlases often contain many small inconsistently labeled or
		  disconnected regions that need to be identified and
		  corrected. This project proposes an efficient process to
		  drastically reduce the time necessary for manual revision
		  in order to improve atlas label quality.We introduce the
		  LabelAtlasEditor tool, a SimpleITK-based open-source label
		  atlas correction tool distributed within the image
		  visualization software 3D Slicer. LabelAtlasEditor
		  incorporates several 3D Slicer widgets into one consistent
		  interface and provides label-specific correction tools,
		  allowing for rapid identification, navigation, and
		  modification of the small, disconnected erroneous labels
		  within an atlas. The technical details for the
		  implementation and performance of LabelAtlasEditor are
		  demonstrated using an application of improving a set of 20
		  Huntingtons Disease-specific multi-modal brain atlases.
		  Additionally, we present the advantages and limitations of
		  automatic atlas correction. After the correction of atlas
		  inconsistencies and small, disconnected regions, the number
		  of unidentified voxels for each dataset was reduced on
		  average by 68.48{\%}.},

@Article{	  friston1997,
  abstract	= {In this paper we introduce the idea of explaining
		  responses, in one cortical area, in terms of an interaction
		  between the influence of another area and some experimental
		  (sensory or task-related) parameter. We refer to these
		  effects as psychophysiological interactions and relate them
		  to interactions based solely on experimental factors (i.e.,
		  psychological interactions), in factorial designs, and
		  interactions among neurophysiological measurements (i.e.,
		  physiological interactions). We have framed
		  psychophysiological interactions in terms of functional
		  integration by noting that the degree to which the activity
		  in one area can be predicted, on the basis of activity in
		  another, corresponds to the contribution of the second to
		  the first, where this contribution can be related to
		  effective connectivity. A psychophysiological interaction
		  means that the contribution of one area to another changes
		  significantly with the experimental or psychological
		  context. Alternatively these interactions can be thought of
		  as a contribution-dependent change in regional responses to
		  an experimental or psychological factor. In other words the
		  contribution can be thought of as modulating the responses
		  elicited by a particular stimulus or psychological process.
		  The potential importance of this approach lies in (i)
		  conferring a degree of functional specificity on this
		  aspect of effective connectivity and (ii) providing a model
		  of modulation, where the contribution from a distal area
		  can be considered to modulate responses to the
		  psychological or stimulus-specific factor defining the
		  interaction. Although distinct in neurobiological terms,
		  these are equivalent perspectives on the same underlying
		  interaction. We illustrate these points using a functional
		  magnetic resonance imaging study of attention to visual
		  motion and a position emission tomography study of visual
		  priming. We focus on interactions among extrastriate,
		  inferotemporal, and posterior parietal regions during
		  visual processing, under different attentional and
		  perceptual conditions.},

###Article{	  friston1997,
  abstract	= {In this paper we introduce the idea of explaining
		  responses, in one cortical area, in terms of an interaction
		  between the influence of another area and some experimental
		  (sensory or task-related) parameter. We refer to these
		  effects as psychophysiological interactions and relate them
		  to interactions based solely on experimental factors (i.e.,
		  psychological interactions), in factorial designs, and
		  interactions among neurophysiological measurements (i.e.,
		  physiological interactions). We have framed
		  psychophysiological interactions in terms of functional
		  integration by noting that the degree to which the activity
		  in one area can be predicted, on the basis of activity in
		  another, corresponds to the contribution of the second to
		  the first, where this contribution can be related to
		  effective connectivity. A psychophysiological interaction
		  means that the contribution of one area to another changes
		  significantly with the experimental or psychological
		  context. Alternatively these interactions can be thought of
		  as a contribution-dependent change in regional responses to
		  an experimental or psychological factor. In other words the
		  contribution can be thought of as modulating the responses
		  elicited by a particular stimulus or psychological process.
		  The potential importance of this approach lies in (i)
		  conferring a degree of functional specificity on this
		  aspect of effective connectivity and (ii) providing a model
		  of modulation, where the contribution from a distal area
		  can be considered to modulate responses to the
		  psychological or stimulus-specific factor defining the
		  interaction. Although distinct in neurobiological terms,
		  these are equivalent perspectives on the same underlying
		  interaction. We illustrate these points using a functional
		  magnetic resonance imaging study of attention to visual
		  motion and a position emission tomography study of visual
		  priming. We focus on interactions among extrastriate,
		  inferotemporal, and posterior parietal regions during
		  visual processing, under different attentional and
		  perceptual conditions.},

		  improve functioning in older adults. Baseline neural
		  factors, such as properties of brain networks, may predict
		  training outcomes and can be used to improve the
		  effectiveness of interventions. Here, we investigated the
		  relationship between baseline brain network modularity, a
		  measure of the segregation of brain sub-networks, and
		  training-related gains in cognition in older adults. We
		  found that older adults with more segregated brain
		  sub-networks (i.e., more modular networks) at baseline
		  exhibited greater training improvements in the ability to
		  synthesize complex information. Further, the relationship
		  between modularity and training-related gains was more
		  pronounced in sub-networks mediating "associative"
		  functions compared with those involved in sensory-motor
		  processing. These results suggest that assessments of brain
		  networks can be used as a biomarker to guide the
		  implementation of cognitive interventions and improve
		  outcomes across individuals. More broadly, these findings
		  also suggest that properties of brain networks may capture
		  individual differences in learning and neuroplasticity.},

@Article{	  ghaemi2007a,
  abstract	= {OBJECTIVE: To assess the scientific and ethical basis for
		  clinical innovation in psychopharmacology. METHODS: We
		  conducted a literature review, utilizing MEDLINE search and
		  bibliographic cross-referencing, and historical evidence
		  regarding the discovery and development of new medications
		  in psychiatry. Clinical innovation was defined as use of
		  treatments in a clinical setting which have not been
		  well-proven in a research setting. RESULTS: Empirical data
		  regarding the impact of clinical innovation in
		  psychopharmacology are lacking. A conceptual and historical
		  assessment of this topic highlights the ethical and
		  scientific importance of clinical innovation. Ethically, it
		  touches a borderline that, in our judgment, is not
		  adequately framed in contemporary mainstream bioethics.
		  Currently, research is viewed as not at all benefiting the
		  patients who participate in it, while clinical care is
		  viewed as being solely for the benefit of patients.
		  Clinical innovation straddles these two worlds,
		  uncomfortably at times. While many argue that clinical
		  innovation should either be avoided or folded into research
		  projects, we argue that clinical innovation is necessary
		  for progress in psychopharmacology research, and that it
		  can prosper best when guided by the following ethical
		  principles: 1.) The treatment should be based on a viable
		  hypothesis. 2.) Whenever possible, one's clinical
		  observations should be reported so they can be evaluated by
		  the scientific community. 3.) One should be willing to
		  report unexpected observations of drug effects. 4.) A high
		  standard of informed consent should be maintained. Again,
		  this proposal goes against the standard view among
		  bioethicists that research and clinical care are
		  categorically opposed activities, as made clear by the
		  either-or dichotomy of the Belmont Report on bioethics.
		  This approach has so polarized our profession into
		  clinicians versus researchers, that many clinicians will
		  not apply new knowledge produced by clinical research until
		  it eventually gets incorporated into formal treatment
		  guidelines, while researchers have little to guide them as
		  to what kind of new knowledge it is most important to
		  provide. SUMMARY: Clinical innovation brings out the
		  ambiguities in our current ethical conceptions of research
		  versus clinical care. Yet, historically, clinical
		  innovation has been an important contributor to progress in
		  psychopharmacology. We argue that clinical innovation
		  should not be discouraged, but rather it should occur under
		  certain ethical conditions."Almost everyone can and should
		  do research...because almost everyone has a unique
		  observational opportunity at some time in his life which he
		  has an obligation to record.... If one considers the
		  fundamental operations or methods of research, one
		  immediately realizes that most people do research at some
		  time or another, except that they do not call their
		  activity by that name. There are seven operations.... In
		  simple language they are counting, sorting, measuring,
		  comparing, nature-study, guess testing, and reappraisal....
		  Guess testing is of course what most people think of when
		  the word research is mentioned; except that it is bad
		  manners to call a guess a guess. It should be called an
		  hypothesis. Let us make one plea. Guessing becomes merely a
		  game unless it is done in the context of a plan for action.
		  It is a waste of time elaborating untestable hypotheses 1."

###Article{	  ghaemi2007a,
  abstract	= {OBJECTIVE: To assess the scientific and ethical basis for
		  clinical innovation in psychopharmacology. METHODS: We
		  conducted a literature review, utilizing MEDLINE search and
		  bibliographic cross-referencing, and historical evidence
		  regarding the discovery and development of new medications
		  in psychiatry. Clinical innovation was defined as use of
		  treatments in a clinical setting which have not been
		  well-proven in a research setting. RESULTS: Empirical data
		  regarding the impact of clinical innovation in
		  psychopharmacology are lacking. A conceptual and historical
		  assessment of this topic highlights the ethical and
		  scientific importance of clinical innovation. Ethically, it
		  touches a borderline that, in our judgment, is not
		  adequately framed in contemporary mainstream bioethics.
		  Currently, research is viewed as not at all benefiting the
		  patients who participate in it, while clinical care is
		  viewed as being solely for the benefit of patients.
		  Clinical innovation straddles these two worlds,
		  uncomfortably at times. While many argue that clinical
		  innovation should either be avoided or folded into research
		  projects, we argue that clinical innovation is necessary
		  for progress in psychopharmacology research, and that it
		  can prosper best when guided by the following ethical
		  principles: 1.) The treatment should be based on a viable
		  hypothesis. 2.) Whenever possible, one's clinical
		  observations should be reported so they can be evaluated by
		  the scientific community. 3.) One should be willing to
		  report unexpected observations of drug effects. 4.) A high
		  standard of informed consent should be maintained. Again,
		  this proposal goes against the standard view among
		  bioethicists that research and clinical care are
		  categorically opposed activities, as made clear by the
		  either-or dichotomy of the Belmont Report on bioethics.
		  This approach has so polarized our profession into
		  clinicians versus researchers, that many clinicians will
		  not apply new knowledge produced by clinical research until
		  it eventually gets incorporated into formal treatment
		  guidelines, while researchers have little to guide them as
		  to what kind of new knowledge it is most important to
		  provide. SUMMARY: Clinical innovation brings out the
		  ambiguities in our current ethical conceptions of research
		  versus clinical care. Yet, historically, clinical
		  innovation has been an important contributor to progress in
		  psychopharmacology. We argue that clinical innovation
		  should not be discouraged, but rather it should occur under
		  certain ethical conditions."Almost everyone can and should
		  do research...because almost everyone has a unique
		  observational opportunity at some time in his life which he
		  has an obligation to record.... If one considers the
		  fundamental operations or methods of research, one
		  immediately realizes that most people do research at some
		  time or another, except that they do not call their
		  activity by that name. There are seven operations.... In
		  simple language they are counting, sorting, measuring,
		  comparing, nature-study, guess testing, and reappraisal....
		  Guess testing is of course what most people think of when
		  the word research is mentioned; except that it is bad
		  manners to call a guess a guess. It should be called an
		  hypothesis. Let us make one plea. Guessing becomes merely a
		  game unless it is done in the context of a plan for action.
		  It is a waste of time elaborating untestable hypotheses 1."

		  Previous studies have developed a robust multi-modal tool

		  aims to augment the EM-based classification using a

		  that can model the unique anatomical states of each subject
		  in the study of degenerative diseases. The presented method
		  is applicable to multi-center heterogeneous data analysis
		  and is quantitatively validated on a set of 18 synthetic
		  multi-modal MR datasets having six different levels of
		  noise and three degrees of bias-field provided with known
		  ground truth. Dice index and average Hausdorff distance are
		  used to compare the accuracy and robustness of the proposed
		  method to a state-of-the-art classification method
		  implemented based on EM algorithm. Both evaluation
		  measurements show that presented enhancements produce

  abstract	= {A robust fully automated algorithm for identifying an
		  arbitrary number of landmark points in the human brain is
		  described and validated. The proposed method combines
		  statistical shape models with trained brain morphometric
		  measures to estimate midbrain landmark positions reliably
		  and accurately. Gross morphometric constraints provided by
		  automatically identified eye centers and the center of the
		  head mass are shown to provide robust initialization in the
		  presence of large rotations in the initial head
		  orientation. Detection of primary midbrain landmarks are
		  used as the foundation from which extended detection of an
		  arbitrary set of secondary landmarks in different brain
		  regions by applying a linear model estimation and principle
		  component analysis. This estimation model sequentially uses
		  the knowledge of each additional detected landmark as an
		  improved foundation for improved prediction of the next
		  landmark location. The accuracy and robustness of the
		  presented method was evaluated by comparing the
		  automatically generated results to two manual raters on 30
		  identified landmark points extracted from each of 30
		  T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. For the landmarks
		  with unambiguous anatomical definitions, the average
		  discrepancy between the algorithm results and each human
		  observer differed by less than 1 mm from the average
		  inter-observer variability when the algorithm was evaluated
		  on imaging data collected from the same site as the model
		  building data. Similar results were obtained when the same
		  model was applied to a set of heterogeneous image volumes
		  from seven different collection sites representing 3

		  application in large-scale multi-site studies that consist

  abstract	= {Intrinsic functional connectivity magnetic resonance
		  imaging (iFCMRI) provides an encouraging approach for
		  mapping large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs)
		  in the "resting" brain. Structural connections as measured
		  by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are a major constraint on
		  the identified ICNs. This study aimed at the combined
		  investigation of ten well-defined ICNs in healthy elderly
		  subjects at single subject level as well as at the group
		  level, together with the underlying structural
		  connectivity. IFCMRI and DTI data were acquired in twelve
		  subjects (68 ± 7 years) at a 3T scanner and were studied
		  using the tensor imaging and fiber tracking software
		  package. The seed-based iFCMRI analysis approach was
		  comprehensively performed with DTI analysis, following
		  standardized procedures including an 8-step processing of
		  iFCMRI data. Our findings demonstrated robust ICNs at the
		  single subject level and conclusive brain maps at the group
		  level in the healthy elderly sample, supported by the
		  complementary fiber tractography. The findings demonstrated
		  here provide a methodological framework for future
		  comparisons of pathological (e.g., neurodegenerative)
		  conditions with healthy controls on the basis of
		  multiparametric functional connectivity mapping.},

@Article{	  grady2016,
  abstract	= {Older adults typically show weaker functional connectivity
		  (FC) within brain networks compared with young adults, but
		  stronger functional connections between networks. Our
		  primary aim here was to use a graph theoretical approach to
		  identify age differences in the FC of 3 networks-default
		  mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network, and
		  frontoparietal control (FPC)-during rest and task
		  conditions and test the hypothesis that age differences in
		  the FPC would influence age differences in the other
		  networks, consistent with its role as a cognitive "switch."
		  At rest, older adults showed lower clustering values
		  compared with the young, and both groups showed more
		  between-network connections involving the FPC than the
		  other 2 networks, but this difference was greater in the
		  older adults. Connectivity within the DMN was reduced in
		  older compared with younger adults. Consistent with our
		  hypothesis, between-network connections of the FPC at rest
		  predicted the age-related reduction in connectivity within
		  the DMN. There was no age difference in within-network FC
		  during the task (after removing the specific task effect),
		  but between-network connections were greater in older
		  adults than in young adults for the FPC and dorsal
		  attention network. In addition, age reductions were found
		  in almost all the graph metrics during the task condition,
		  including clustering and modularity. Finally, age
		  differences in between-network connectivity of the FPC
		  during both rest and task predicted cognitive performance.
		  These findings provide additional evidence of less
		  within-network but greater between-network FC in older
		  adults during rest but also show that these age differences
		  can be altered by the residual influence of task demands on
		  background connectivity. Our results also support a role
		  for the FPC as the regulator of other brain networks in the
		  service of cognition. Critically, the link between age
		  differences in inter-network connections of the FPC and DMN
		  connectivity, and the link between FPC connectivity and
		  performance, support the hypothesis that FC of the FPC
		  influences the expression of age differences in other
		  networks, as well as differences in cognitive function.},

		  become structurally and functionally weaker in aging. Here
		  we investigated functional and structural age-related
		  changes in switching between a spatial and a verbal task.
		  These tasks were chosen because they are expected to
		  differentially use the two hemispheres. Brain measures
		  included anatomical information about anterior corpus

		  (EROS). Behavioral results indicated that older adults had

		  task-specific activity in the inferior frontal gyrus,

  abstract	= {Traditional theories of moral psychology emphasize
		  reasoning and "higher cognition," while more recent work
		  emphasizes the role of emotion. The present fMRI data
		  support a theory of moral judgment according to which both
		  "cognitive" and emotional processes play crucial and
		  sometimes mutually competitive roles. The present results
		  indicate that brain regions associated with abstract
		  reasoning and cognitive control (including dorsolateral
		  prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) are
		  recruited to resolve difficult personal moral dilemmas in
		  which utilitarian values require "personal" moral
		  violations, violations that have previously been associated
		  with increased activity in emotion-related brain regions.
		  Several regions of frontal and parietal cortex predict
		  intertrial differences in moral judgment behavior,
		  exhibiting greater activity for utilitarian judgments. We
		  speculate that the controversy surrounding utilitarian
		  moral philosophy reflects an underlying tension between
		  competing subsystems in the brain.},

		  examined the effects of an acute bout of physical exercise
		  as well as four weeks of exercise training on the
		  individual resting state electroencephalographic (EEG)
		  alpha peak frequency (iAPF), a neurophysiological marker of
		  the individual's state of arousal and attention, in healthy
		  young adults. The subjects completed a steady state
		  exercise (SSE) protocol or an exhaustive exercise (EE)
		  protocol, respectively, on two separate days. EEG activity
		  was recorded for 2 min before exercise, immediately after
		  exercise, and after 10 min of rest. All assessments were
		  repeated following four weeks of exercise training to
		  investigate whether an improvement in physical fitness
		  modulates the resting state iAPF and/or the iAPF response
		  to an acute bout of SSE and EE. The iAPF was significantly
		  increased following EE ( P=0.012 ) but not following SSE.
		  It is concluded that the iAPF is increased following
		  intense exercise, indicating a higher level of arousal and
		  preparedness for external input. },

		  influence of different APE intensities on post-exercise
		  iAPF as well as its time course after exercise cessation.
		  95 healthy young (18–35 years) subjects participated in
		  two randomized controlled experiments (EX1 and EX2). In
		  EX1, all participants completed a graded exercise test
		  (GXT) until exhaustion and were randomly allocated into
		  different delay groups (immediately 0, 30, 60 and 90 min
		  after GXT). The iAPF was determined before, immediately
		  after as well as after the group-specific delay following
		  the GXT. In EX2, participants exercised for 35 min at
		  either 45–50{\%}, 65–70{\%} or 85–90{\%} of their
		  maximum heart rate (HRmax). The iAPF was determined before,
		  immediately after as well as 20 min after exercise
		  cessation. In EX1, the iAPF was significantly increased
		  immediately after the GXT in all groups. This effect was
		  not any more detectable after 30 min following exercise
		  cessation. In EX2, a significant increase of the iAPF was
		  found only after high-intensity (85–90{\%} HRmax)
		  exercise. The results indicate intense or exhaustive
		  physical exercise is required to induce a transient
		  increase in the iAPF that persists about 30 min following

		  research will have to scrutinize the behavioral
		  implications associated with iAPF modulations following

		  participants to demonstrate options for psychometric
		  analyses of neural measures; we examine between-groups
		  differences in internal consistency, between-groups effect
		  sizes, and between-groups discriminability (i.e., ROC
		  analyses)-all as a function of increasing items (i.e.,
		  number of trials). Overall, internal consistency should be
		  used to inform experimental design and the choice of neural
		  measures in individual differences research. The internal

		  interpreting results and guiding progress in clinical

@Book{		  harlow1997,
  abstract	= {Longitudinal Analysis provides an accessible,
		  application-oriented treatment of intro-ductory and
		  advanced linear models for within-person fluctuation and
		  change. Organized by research design and data type, the
		  text uses in-depth examples to pro-vide a complete
		  description of the model-building process. The core
		  longitudinal models and their extensions are presented
		  within a multilevel modeling framework, paying careful
		  attention to the modeling concerns that are unique to
		  longitudinal data. Written in a conversational style, the
		  text provides verbal and visual interpre-tation of model
		  equations to aid in their translation to empirical research
		  results. Overviews and summaries, boldfaced key terms, and
		  review questions will help readers synthesize the key
		  concepts in each chapter. Written for non-mathematically
		  oriented readers, this text features: • A description of
		  the data manipulation steps required prior to model
		  estima-tion so readers can more easily apply the steps to
		  their own data. • An emphasis on how the terminology,
		  interpretation, and estimation of famil-iar general linear
		  models relate to those of more complex models for
		  longitudi-nal data. • Integrated model comparisons,
		  effect sizes, and statistical inference in each example to
		  strengthen readers' understanding of the overall
		  model-building process. • Sample results sections for
		  each example to provide useful templates for pub-lished
		  reports. • Examples using both real and simulated data in
		  the text, along with syntax and output for SAS, SPSS,
		  STATA, and Mplus at www.PilesOfVariance.com to help readers
		  apply the models to their own data. Class-tested at the
		  University of Nebraska–Lincoln and in intensive summer
		  workshops, this is an ideal text for graduate-level courses
		  on longitudinal analysis or general multilevel modeling
		  taught in psychology, human development and family studies,
		  education, business, and other behavioral, social, and
		  health sci-ences. The book's accessible approach will also
		  help those trying to learn on their own. Only familiarity
		  with general linear models (regression, analysis of
		  variance) is needed for this text. The Multivariate
		  Applications book series was developed to encourage the use
		  of rig-orous methodology in the study of meaningful
		  scientific issues and to describe the applications in
		  easy-to-understand language. The series is sponsored by the
		  Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology and
		  welcomes methodological applica-tions from a variety of
		  disciplines, such as psychology, public health, sociology,
		  education, and business. Books can be single authored,
		  multiple authored, or edited volumes. The ideal book for
		  this series would take on one of several approaches: (1)
		  demonstrate the application of several multivariate methods
		  to a single, major area of research; (2) describe a
		  multivariate procedure or framework that could be applied
		  to a number of research areas; or (3) present a discussion
		  of a topic of inter-est to applied multivariate
		  researchers. Previous books in the series:},

###Article{	  harrison2009,
  abstract	= {The effects of abnormally high or low stress on learning
		  are well established. The Barnes maze and Morris water maze
		  are two commonly used tests of spatial memory, of which the
		  water maze is considered more stressful; however, until now
		  this has not been demonstrated empirically. In the present
		  study, mice matched for performance on commonly used
		  anxiety tasks were trained on either the Barnes maze or
		  water maze or received no cognitive testing. Water-maze
		  training induced greater increases in plasma corticosterone
		  than did Barnes maze training, assessed 30 min after the
		  final session. Importantly, spatial learning was inversely
		  correlated with corticosterone levels in the water maze but
		  not the Barnes maze, suggesting that performance on the
		  water maze may be more affected by test-induced stress even
		  within wild-type subjects of the same age and gender. These
		  findings are important when considering the appropriate
		  cognitive tasks for any experiment in which stress
		  responses may differ systematically across groups.},

  abstract	= {Individual differences in cognitive paradigms are
		  increasingly employed to relate cognition to brain
		  structure, chemistry, and function. However, such efforts
		  are often unfruitful, even with the most well established
		  tasks. Here we offer an explanation for failures in the
		  application of robust cognitive paradigms to the study of
		  individual differences. Experimental effects become well
		  established – and thus those tasks become popular –
		  when between-subject variability is low. However, low
		  between-subject variability causes low reliability for
		  individual differences, destroying replicable correlations
		  with other factors and potentially undermining published
		  conclusions drawn from correlational relationships. Though
		  these statistical issues have a long history in psychology,
		  they are widely overlooked in cognitive psychology and
		  neuroscience today. In three studies, we assessed
		  test-retest reliability of seven classic tasks: Eriksen
		  Flanker, Stroop, stop-signal, go/no-go, Posner cueing,
		  Navon, and Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Code
		  (SNARC). Reliabilities ranged from 0 to.82, being
		  surprisingly low for most tasks given their common use. As
		  we predicted, this emerged from low variance between
		  individuals rather than high measurement variance. In other
		  words, the very reason such tasks produce robust and easily
		  replicable experimental effects – low between-participant
		  variability – makes their use as correlational tools
		  problematic. We demonstrate that taking such reliability
		  estimates into account has the potential to qualitatively
		  change theoretical conclusions. The implications of our
		  findings are that well-established approaches in
		  experimental psychology and neuropsychology may not
		  directly translate to the study of individual differences
		  in brain structure, chemistry, and function, and
		  alternative metrics may be required.},

  abstract	= {We address the connection between conceptual knowledge and
		  cognitive control using a neural network model. This model
		  extends a widely held theory of cognitive control [Cohen,
		  J. D., Dunbar, K., {\&} McClelland, J. L. On the control of
		  automatic processes: A parallel distributed processing
		  model of the Stroop effect. Psychological Review, 97,
		  332-361, 1990] so that it can explain new empirical
		  findings. Leveraging other computational modeling work, we
		  hypothesize that representations used for task control are
		  recruited from preexisting representations for categories,
		  such as the concept of color relevant to the Stroop task we
		  model here. This hypothesis allows the model to account for
		  otherwise puzzling fMRI results, such as increased activity
		  in brain regions processing to-be-ignored information. In
		  addition, biologically motivated changes in the model's
		  pattern of connectivity show how global competition can
		  arise when inhibition is strictly local, as it seems to be
		  in the cortex. We also discuss the potential for this
		  theory to unify models of task control with other forms of
		  attention.},

  abstract	= {The data revolution has led to an increased interest in
		  the practice of data analysis. As a result, there has been
		  a proliferation of "data science" training programs.
		  Because data science has been previously defined as an
		  intersection of already-established fields or union of
		  emerging technologies, the following problems arise: (1)
		  There is little agreement about what is data science; (2)
		  Data science becomes secondary to established fields in a
		  university setting; and (3) It is difficult to have
		  discussions on what it means to learn about data science,
		  to teach data science courses and to be a data scientist.
		  To address these problems, we propose to define the field
		  from first principles based on the activities of people who
		  analyze data with a language and taxonomy for describing a
		  data analysis in a manner spanning disciplines. Here, we
		  describe the elements and principles of data analysis. This
		  leads to two insights: it suggests a formal mechanism to
		  evaluate data analyses based on objective characteristics,
		  and it provides a framework to teach students how to build
		  data analyses. We argue that the elements and principles of
		  data analysis lay the foundational framework for a more
		  general theory of data science.},

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: The study aims were to compare raw tri-axial
		  accelerometer output from ActiGraph GT3X + (AG) and
		  GENEActiv (GA) placed on the hip and the wrist and to
		  develop regression equations for estimating energy
		  expenditure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Thirty
		  children (7-11 yr.) and 30 adults (18-65 yr.) completed
		  eight activities (ranging from lying to running) whilst
		  wearing one AG and one GA on the hip and the wrist. Oxygen
		  consumption (VO2) was measured with indirect calorimetry.
		  Analysis involved the use of ANOVA to examine the effect of
		  activity, brand and placement on the acceleration values,
		  ICC to evaluate the agreement between the two brands and
		  placements and linear regression to establish intensity
		  thresholds.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A significant
		  difference in acceleration values between the hip and the
		  wrist placement was found (p {\textless} 0.001). The output
		  from the wrist placement was in general higher compared to
		  the hip. There was no main effect of monitor brand in
		  adults (p {\textless} 0.12) and children (p {\textless}
		  0.73) and the ICC showed a strong agreement (0.96-0.99).
		  However, a three-way interaction and systematic error
		  between the brands was found in children. Acceleration from
		  both brands and placements showed a strong correlation with
		  VO2. The intensity classification accuracy of the developed
		  thresholds for both brands and placements were in general
		  higher for adults compared to children and were greater for
		  sedentary/light (93-97{\%}), and vigorous activities
		  (68-92{\%}), than moderate activities
		  (33-59{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:
		  Accelerometer output from AG and GA appears comparable when
		  attached to the same body location in adults, whereas
		  non-consistent differences are apparent between the two
		  brands and placements in children, hence limiting the
		  comparability between brands in this age group.This is an

		  study. Reading and executive functions behavioral measures
		  and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
		  data were collected before and after reading training.
		  Imaging data were analyzed using a graphical
		  network-modeling tool. Both reading groups had increased
		  reading and executive-functions scores after training, with
		  greater gains among the dyslexia group. Training may have
		  less effect on cognitive control in typical readers and a
		  more direct effect on the visual area, as previously
		  reported. Statistical analysis revealed that compared to
		  typical readers, children with reading difficulty had
		  significantly greater functional connectivity in the
		  cingulo-opercular network after training, which may
		  demonstrate the importance of cognitive control during
		  reading in this population. These results support previous
		  findings of increased error-monitoring activation after
		  reading training in children with dyslexia and confirm
		  greater gains with training in this group.},

		  who were exposed to at least 75{\%} of the program material
		  were explored. Descriptive analysis and logistical
		  regression were used to examine differences between groups
		  for program exposure. Results: All groups showed decrease
		  in program exposure over time. Differences were also
		  observed ($\chi$2 = 10.37, p {\textless} 0.05), between
		  intervention groups. The internet-mediated (OR = 2.4,
		  95{\%} CI 1.13–5.1) and internet-only (OR = 2.96, 95{\%}
		  CI 1.38–6.3) groups were more likely to have been exposed
		  to at least 75{\%} of the program compared to the
		  face-to-face group. Participants with high physical
		  activity self-efficacy were 1.82 (95{\%} CI 1.15–2.88)
		  times more likely to have been exposed to 75{\%} of the
		  program, and those allocated to the face-to-face group were
		  less likely to have attended 75{\%} of the face-to-face
		  sessions if they were classified as obese (OR = 0.21 95{\%}
		  CI 0.04–0.96). Conclusion: These results suggest that the
		  internet groups were as effective as the face-to-face
		  delivery mode in engaging participants in the program
		  material. However, different delivery methods may be more
		  useful to different sub-populations. It is important to
		  explore which target groups that internet-based programs
		  are best suited, in order to increase their impact.},

  abstract	= {Cognitive aging studies have suggested that older adults
		  show declines in both sustained and transient cognitive
		  control processes. However, previous neuroimaging studies
		  have primarily focused on age-related change in the
		  magnitude, but not temporal dynamics, of brain activity.
		  The present study compared brain activity dynamics in
		  healthy old and young adults during task switching. A mixed
		  blocked/event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
		  design enabled separation of transient and sustained neural
		  activity associated with cognitive control. Relative to
		  young adults, older adults exhibited not only decreased
		  sustained activity in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC)
		  during task-switching blocks but also increased transient
		  activity on task-switch trials. Another pattern of
		  age-related shift in dynamics was present in the lateral
		  PFC (lPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), with
		  younger adults showing a cue-related response during
		  task-switch trials in lPFC and PPC, whereas older adults
		  exhibited switch-related activation during the cue period
		  in PPC only. In all 3 regions, these qualitatively distinct
		  patterns of brain activity predicted qualitatively distinct
		  patterns of behavioral performance across the 2 age groups.
		  Together, these results suggest that older adults may shift
		  from a proactive to reactive cognitive control strategy as
		  a means of retaining relatively preserved behavioral
		  performance in the face of age-related neurocognitive
		  changes.},

  abstract	= {Cognitive aging studies have suggested that older adults
		  show declines in both sustained and transient cognitive
		  control processes. However, previous neuroimaging studies
		  have primarily focused on age-related change in the
		  magnitude, but not temporal dynamics, of brain activity.
		  The present study compared brain activity dynamics in
		  healthy old and young adults during task switching. A mixed
		  blocked/event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
		  design enabled separation of transient and sustained neural
		  activity associated with cognitive control. Relative to
		  young adults, older adults exhibited not only decreased
		  sustained activity in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC)
		  during task-switching blocks but also increased transient
		  activity on task-switch trials. Another pattern of
		  age-related shift in dynamics was present in the lateral
		  PFC (lPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), with
		  younger adults showing a cue-related response during
		  task-switch trials in lPFC and PPC, whereas older adults
		  exhibited switch-related activation during the cue period
		  in PPC only. In all 3 regions, these qualitatively distinct
		  patterns of brain activity predicted qualitatively distinct
		  patterns of behavioral performance across the 2 age groups.
		  Together, these results suggest that older adults may shift
		  from a proactive to reactive cognitive control strategy as
		  a means of retaining relatively preserved behavioral
		  performance in the face of age-related neurocognitive
		  changes.},

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the influence of
		  an acute bout of moderate exercise and examine the
		  potential lasting improvements over time in young and old
		  adults within the same experimental paradigm over a 2-h
		  testing period. The study was designed to assess the
		  efficiency of selective control and the propensity to make
		  fast impulsive reactions through the analyses of the
		  percentage of correct responses (CAF) and the magnitude of
		  the interference effect (delta curve) as a function of the
		  latency of the response.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS:
		  Twelve young (23 ± 2 yr) and 12 old (63 ± 2 yr)
		  volunteers performed the Simon task while cycling (30 min
		  of cycling at 65{\%} of age-predicted HRmax) and after
		  exercise cessation (post 5 min, post 35 min, and post 65
		  min).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Results showed that
		  exercise did not alter cognitive control. The benefit on
		  reaction time performance was evident for both age groups
		  and persisted after cessation for 15-20 min. Distributional
		  analyses showed that younger people have a higher
		  propensity to commit impulsive errors during exercise,
		  which was not evident in older adults. Older adults adopted
		  more cautious strategies, especially when the risk to
		  commit an error was elevated. Despite the larger mean
		  interference effect compared to younger adults, the pattern
		  of the delta curves attests to the existence of an
		  efficient cognitive control in older
		  people.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study
		  illustrates the effectiveness of distributional analyses
		  and supports the idea that exercise-induced facilitation on
		  cognitive performance can be realized across the lifespan.
		  Future investigations should explore whether accumulated
		  bouts of acute exercise could display an aggregate
		  cognitive benefit, which may significantly affect
		  independent functioning in older adults.},

  abstract	= {PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the influence of
		  an acute bout of moderate exercise and examine the
		  potential lasting improvements over time in young and old
		  adults within the same experimental paradigm over a 2-h
		  testing period. The study was designed to assess the
		  efficiency of selective control and the propensity to make
		  fast impulsive reactions through the analyses of the
		  percentage of correct responses (CAF) and the magnitude of
		  the interference effect (delta curve) as a function of the
		  latency of the response.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS:
		  Twelve young (23 ± 2 yr) and 12 old (63 ± 2 yr)
		  volunteers performed the Simon task while cycling (30 min
		  of cycling at 65{\%} of age-predicted HRmax) and after
		  exercise cessation (post 5 min, post 35 min, and post 65
		  min).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Results showed that
		  exercise did not alter cognitive control. The benefit on
		  reaction time performance was evident for both age groups
		  and persisted after cessation for 15-20 min. Distributional
		  analyses showed that younger people have a higher
		  propensity to commit impulsive errors during exercise,
		  which was not evident in older adults. Older adults adopted
		  more cautious strategies, especially when the risk to
		  commit an error was elevated. Despite the larger mean
		  interference effect compared to younger adults, the pattern
		  of the delta curves attests to the existence of an
		  efficient cognitive control in older
		  people.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study
		  illustrates the effectiveness of distributional analyses
		  and supports the idea that exercise-induced facilitation on
		  cognitive performance can be realized across the lifespan.
		  Future investigations should explore whether accumulated
		  bouts of acute exercise could display an aggregate
		  cognitive benefit, which may significantly affect
		  independent functioning in older adults.},

		  with — and be able to answer — the questions in The
		  Science of Learning. Their answers should be informed and
		  guided by the existing scientific consensus around basic
		  cognitive principles. And all educators, including new
		  teachers, should be able to connect these principles to
		  their practical implications for the classroom (or wherever
		  teaching and learning take place). The Science of Learning

		  we present GLMdenoise, a technique that improves
		  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by entering noise regressors
		  into a general linear model (GLM) analysis of fMRI data.
		  The noise regressors are derived by conducting an initial

		  to select the optimal number of principal components to use

		  cross-validation accuracy of GLM estimates on a variety of
		  event-related experimental datasets and is accompanied by
		  substantial gains in SNR. To promote practical application
		  of methods, we provide MATLAB code implementing GLMdenoise.
		  Furthermore, to help compare GLMdenoise to other denoising

  abstract	= {Multicenter longitudinal neuroimaging has great potential
		  to provide efficient and consistent biomarkers for research
		  of neurodegenerative diseases and aging. In rare disease
		  studies it is of primary importance to have a reliable tool
		  that performs consistently for data from many different
		  collection sites to increase study power. A multi-atlas
		  labeling algorithm is a powerful brain image segmentation
		  approach that is becoming increasingly popular in image
		  processing. The present study examined the performance of
		  multi-atlas labeling tools for subcortical identification
		  using two types of in-vivo image database: Traveling Human
		  Phantom (THP) and PREDICT-HD. We compared the accuracy
		  (Dice Similarity Coefficient; DSC and intraclass
		  correlation; ICC), multicenter reliability (Coefficient of
		  Variance; CV), and longitudinal reliability (volume
		  trajectory smoothness and Akaike Information Criterion;
		  AIC) of three automated segmentation approaches: two
		  multi-atlas labeling tools, MABMIS and MALF, and a
		  machine-learning-based tool, BRAINSCut. In general, MALF
		  showed the best performance (higher DSC, ICC, lower CV,
		  AIC, and smoother trajectory) with a couple of exceptions.
		  First, the results of accumben, where BRAINSCut showed
		  higher reliability, were still premature to discuss their
		  reliability levels since their validity is still in doubt
		  (DSC {\textless} 0.7, ICC {\textless} 0.7). For caudate,
		  BRAINSCut presented slightly better accuracy while MALF
		  showed significantly smoother longitudinal trajectory. We
		  discuss advantages and limitations of these performance
		  variations and conclude that improved segmentation quality
		  can be achieved using multi-atlas labeling methods. While
		  multi-atlas labeling methods are likely to help improve
		  overall segmentation quality, caution has to be taken when
		  one chooses an approach, as our results suggest that
		  segmentation outcome can vary depending on research

		  community-dwelling adults, aged 64-77 years, without any
		  history of neurological or psychiatric problems,
		  participated in this study (14 in the training group and 13
		  in the control group). The MTCC was administered to the
		  participants assigned to the training group for 8 weeks,
		  while those in the control group received no training.
		  Neuropsychological tests and fMRI were administered prior
		  to and after the training. Trained participants showed
		  improvements in cognitive control, recognition memory and
		  general cognitive functioning. Furthermore, the MTCC led to
		  an increased brain activation of the regions adjacent to
		  the baseline cognitive control-related areas in the
		  frontoparietal network. Future studies are necessary to
		  confirm our hypothesis that MTCC improves cognitive
		  functioning of healthy elderly individuals by expanding
		  their frontoparietal network that is involved in cognitive
		  control.},

  abstract	= {Amnesic patients and nondemented patients with Parkinson's
		  disease were given a probabilistic classification task in
		  which they learned which of two outcomes would occur on
		  each trial, given the particular combination of cues that
		  appeared. Amnesic patients exhibited normal learning of the
		  task but had severely impaired declarative memory for the
		  training episode. In contrast, patients with Parkinson's
		  disease failed to learn the probabilistic classification
		  task, despite having intact memory for the training
		  episode. This double dissociation shows that the
		  limbic-diencephalic regions damaged in amnesia and the
		  neostriatum damaged in Parkinson's disease support separate
		  and parallel learning systems. In humans, the neostriatum
		  (caudate nucleus and putamen) is essential for the gradual,

  abstract	= {Amnesic patients and nondemented patients with Parkinson's
		  disease were given a probabilistic classification task in
		  which they learned which of two outcomes would occur on
		  each trial, given the particular combination of cues that
		  appeared. Amnesic patients exhibited normal learning of the
		  task but had severely impaired declarative memory for the
		  training episode. In contrast, patients with Parkinson's
		  disease failed to learn the probabilistic classification
		  task, despite having intact memory for the training
		  episode. This double dissociation shows that the
		  limbic-diencephalic regions damaged in amnesia and the
		  neostriatum damaged in Parkinson's disease support separate
		  and parallel learning systems. In humans, the neostriatum
		  (caudate nucleus and putamen) is essential for the gradual,
		  incremental learning of associations that is characteristic
		  of habit learning. The neostriatum is important not just
		  for motor behavior and motor learning but also for

  abstract	= {Let's start with a riddle: what are the Authors referring
		  to? “[It] is one of the greatest accomplishments of the
		  human mind; it makes possible planning, reasoning, problem
		  solving, reading, and abstraction .” (Conway, Jarrold,
		  Kane, Miyake, {\&} Towse, 2007 , p. 3) “ This concept [of
		  it] and its limits is a key part of human condition.
		  [{\ldots}] We need [it] to in language comprehension ,
		  [{\ldots}] ; in arithmetic , [{\ldots}] ; in reasoning ,
		  [{\ldots}] ; and in most other types of cognitive tasks.
		  ” (Cowan, 2005a , p. 2) If it was not for the names of
		  the authors of the above quotes, which no doubt for
		  majority of readers indicate unambiguously the context of
		  “it,” one could think that they are referring to terms
		  like consciousness, abstract thinking, or the g factor. It
		  is even more interesting that these quotes come from first
		  pages of multipage books, where – in accordance with the
		  rule “from the general to the particular” – one gives
		  basic information about one's subject matter. However, as
		  N{\c{e}}cka (in print) felicitously says in a paper
		  concerning this concept: “[{\ldots}] for some 2,500 years
		  of psychology as a branch of philosophy, and then for
		  almost 100 years of its independent development [{\ldots}],
		  it was not considered necessary to use [this] term .”
		  Thus, it is a concept of equal importance in psychology as
		  consciousness, thinking, and intelligence, but much younger.},

		  frequently explained as either a general or specific
		  decline in cognitive functioning with age. In the context
		  of hypotheses suggesting a general decline, it is often
		  proposed that processing speed generally declines with age.
		  A further hypothesis is that an age-related compensation
		  mechanism is associated with a specific cognitive decline.
		  One prominent theory is the compensation hypothesis, which
		  proposes that deteriorated functions are compensated for by
		  higher performing functions. In this study, we used
		  event-related potentials (ERPs) in the context of a GO/NOGO
		  task to examine the age-related changes observed during
		  cognitive control in a large group of healthy subjects aged
		  between 18 and 84 years. The main question we attempted to
		  answer was whether we could find neurophysiological support
		  for either a general decline in processing speed or a
		  compensation strategy. The subjects performed a relatively
		  demanding cued GO/NOGO task with similar omissions and
		  reaction times across the five age groups. The ERP waves of
		  cognitive control, such as N2, P3cue and CNV, were
		  decomposed into latent components by means of a blind

		  hypothesis because the latencies of all cognitive control
		  ERP components increased with age, by 8 ms per decade for
		  the early components ({\textless}200 ms) and by 20 ms per
		  decade for the late components. At the same time, the

		  extinction of conditioned fear responses, respectively.
		  Notably, spine elimination and formation induced by fear
		  conditioning and extinction occur on the same dendritic
		  branches in a cue- and location-specific manner:
		  cue-specific extinction causes formation of dendritic
		  spines within a distance of two micrometres from spines

@Article{	  laviola2003,
  abstract	= {Epidemiological research has emphasized that adolescence
		  is associated with some temperamental and behavioral traits
		  that are typical of this age and that might substantially
		  contribute to both psychological and psychobiological
		  vulnerability. The contribution of the important
		  developmental rearrangements in neurobiological and
		  neuroendocrinological processes has received surprisingly
		  little investigation. The present review summarizes recent
		  work in animal models, indicating that adolescent rodents
		  exhibit marked peculiarities in their spontaneous
		  behavioral repertoire. When compared to adults, adolescents
		  show an unbalanced and 'extremes-oriented' behavior,
		  consisting of an increased novelty seeking, together with
		  decreased novelty-induced stress and anxiety, an increased
		  risk-taking behavior in the plus-maze, as well as elevated
		  levels of impulsivity and restlessness. Age-related
		  discontinuities in the function of monoaminergic systems,
		  which are a main target of abused drugs, can perhaps
		  account for such a profile. In particular, a peculiar
		  function within reward-related dopaminergic brain pathways
		  actually seems to underlie the search for novel and
		  rewarding sensations, as well as changes in the magnitude
		  of psychostimulant effects. The role played by early
		  epigenetic factors in the shaping of novelty-seeking
		  behavior of adolescent and adult rodents are also reviewed.
		  Two examples are considered, namely, subtle variations in
		  the hormonal milieu as a function of intrauterine position
		  and precocious or delayed maturation of nutritional
		  independence as a function of changes in time of weaning.
		  As for spontaneous drug consumption, a prominent
		  vulnerability to the oral intake of nicotine during early
		  adolescence is reported. In conclusion, adolescence in
		  rodents may represent a suitable animal model with enough
		  face- and construct-validity. Actually, this model is able
		  to show behavioral features that resemble those found in
		  human adolescents, including vulnerability to the
		  consumption of psychoactive drugs. {\textcopyright} 2003

###Article{	  laviola2003,
  abstract	= {Epidemiological research has emphasized that adolescence
		  is associated with some temperamental and behavioral traits
		  that are typical of this age and that might substantially
		  contribute to both psychological and psychobiological
		  vulnerability. The contribution of the important
		  developmental rearrangements in neurobiological and
		  neuroendocrinological processes has received surprisingly
		  little investigation. The present review summarizes recent
		  work in animal models, indicating that adolescent rodents
		  exhibit marked peculiarities in their spontaneous
		  behavioral repertoire. When compared to adults, adolescents
		  show an unbalanced and 'extremes-oriented' behavior,
		  consisting of an increased novelty seeking, together with
		  decreased novelty-induced stress and anxiety, an increased
		  risk-taking behavior in the plus-maze, as well as elevated
		  levels of impulsivity and restlessness. Age-related
		  discontinuities in the function of monoaminergic systems,
		  which are a main target of abused drugs, can perhaps
		  account for such a profile. In particular, a peculiar
		  function within reward-related dopaminergic brain pathways
		  actually seems to underlie the search for novel and
		  rewarding sensations, as well as changes in the magnitude
		  of psychostimulant effects. The role played by early
		  epigenetic factors in the shaping of novelty-seeking
		  behavior of adolescent and adult rodents are also reviewed.
		  Two examples are considered, namely, subtle variations in
		  the hormonal milieu as a function of intrauterine position
		  and precocious or delayed maturation of nutritional
		  independence as a function of changes in time of weaning.
		  As for spontaneous drug consumption, a prominent
		  vulnerability to the oral intake of nicotine during early
		  adolescence is reported. In conclusion, adolescence in
		  rodents may represent a suitable animal model with enough
		  face- and construct-validity. Actually, this model is able
		  to show behavioral features that resemble those found in
		  human adolescents, including vulnerability to the
		  consumption of psychoactive drugs. {\textcopyright} 2003

		  Balloon Analogue Risk Task; BART) and to test associations
		  between this measure and self-report measures of
		  risk-related constructs as well as self-reported real-world
		  risk behaviors. The BART evidenced sound experimental
		  properties, and riskiness on the BART was correlated with
		  scores on measures of sensation seeking, impulsivity, and
		  deficiencies in behavioral constraint. Also, riskiness on
		  the BART was correlated with the self-reported occurrence
		  of addictive, health, and safety risk behaviors, with the
		  task accounting for variance in these behaviors beyond that
		  accounted for by demographics and self-report measures of
		  risk-related constructs. These results indicate that the

  abstract	= {There is increasing evidence that acute aerobic exercise
		  is associated with improved cognitive function. However,
		  neural correlates of its cognitive plasticity remain
		  largely unknown. The present study examined the effect of a
		  session of acute aerobic exercise on working memory
		  task-evoked brain activity as well as task performance. A
		  within-subjects design with a counterbalanced order was
		  employed. Fifteen young female participants (M = 19.56,
		  SD = 0.81) were scanned using functional magnetic
		  resonance imaging while performing a working memory task,
		  the N-back task, both following an acute exercise session
		  with 20 minutes of moderate intensity and a control rest
		  session. Although an acute session of exercise did not
		  improve behavioral performance, we observed that it had a
		  significant impact on brain activity during the 2-back
		  condition of the N-back task. Specifically, acute exercise
		  induced increased brain activation in the right middle
		  prefrontal gyrus, the right lingual gyrus, and the left
		  fusiform gyrus as well as deactivations in the anterior
		  cingulate cortexes, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and
		  the right paracentral lobule. Despite the lack of an effect
		  on behavioral measures, significant changes after acute
		  exercise with activation of the prefrontal and occipital
		  cortexes and deactivation of the anterior cingulate
		  cortexes and left frontal hemisphere reflect the
		  improvement of executive control processes, indicating that
		  acute exercise could benefit working memory at a
		  macro-neural level. In addition to its effects on reversing
		  recent obesity and disease trends, our results provide
		  substantial evidence highlighting the importance of
		  promoting physical activity across the lifespan to prevent
		  or reverse cognitive and neural decline.},

  abstract	= {There is increasing evidence that acute aerobic exercise
		  is associated with improved cognitive function. However,
		  neural correlates of its cognitive plasticity remain
		  largely unknown. The present study examined the effect of a
		  session of acute aerobic exercise on working memory
		  task-evoked brain activity as well as task performance. A
		  within-subjects design with a counterbalanced order was
		  employed. Fifteen young female participants (M = 19.56,
		  SD = 0.81) were scanned using functional magnetic
		  resonance imaging while performing a working memory task,
		  the N-back task, both following an acute exercise session
		  with 20 minutes of moderate intensity and a control rest
		  session. Although an acute session of exercise did not
		  improve behavioral performance, we observed that it had a
		  significant impact on brain activity during the 2-back
		  condition of the N-back task. Specifically, acute exercise
		  induced increased brain activation in the right middle
		  prefrontal gyrus, the right lingual gyrus, and the left
		  fusiform gyrus as well as deactivations in the anterior
		  cingulate cortexes, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and
		  the right paracentral lobule. Despite the lack of an effect
		  on behavioral measures, significant changes after acute
		  exercise with activation of the prefrontal and occipital
		  cortexes and deactivation of the anterior cingulate
		  cortexes and left frontal hemisphere reflect the
		  improvement of executive control processes, indicating that
		  acute exercise could benefit working memory at a
		  macro-neural level. In addition to its effects on reversing
		  recent obesity and disease trends, our results provide
		  substantial evidence highlighting the importance of
		  promoting physical activity across the lifespan to prevent
		  or reverse cognitive and neural decline.},

  abstract	= {Localising activity in the human midbrain with
		  conventional functional MRI (fMRI) is challenging because
		  the midbrain nuclei are small and located in an area that
		  is prone to physiological artefacts. Here we present a
		  replicable and automated method to improve the detection
		  and localisation of midbrain fMRI signals. We designed a
		  visual fMRI task that was predicted would activate the
		  superior colliculi (SC) bilaterally. A limited number of
		  coronal slices were scanned, orientated along the long axis
		  of the brainstem, whilst simultaneously recording cardiac
		  and respiratory traces. A novel anatomical registration
		  pathway was used to optimise the localisation of the small
		  midbrain nuclei in stereotactic space. Two additional
		  structural scans were used to improve registration between
		  functional and structural T1-weighted images: an
		  echo-planar image (EPI) that matched the functional data
		  but had whole-brain coverage, and a whole-brain T2-weighted
		  image. This pathway was compared to conventional
		  registration pathways, and was shown to significantly
		  improve midbrain registration. To reduce the physiological
		  artefacts in the functional data, we estimated and removed
		  structured noise using a modified version of a previously
		  described physiological noise model (PNM). Whereas a
		  conventional analysis revealed only unilateral SC activity,
		  the PNM analysis revealed the predicted bilateral activity.
		  We demonstrate that these methods improve the measurement

  abstract	= {In the field of clinical alcohol disorders treatment in
		  North America, abstinence continues to be largely viewed as
		  the optimal treatment goal; however, there is a growing
		  awareness of limitations when abstinence is considered the
		  only successful outcome. Although this issue has been
		  discussed in research settings, new studies on the public
		  health significance of heavy drinking (defined as five or
		  more standard drinks per drinking day in men, and four or
		  more standard drinks per drinking day in women) in the past
		  10 years suggest that clinical providers should consider
		  the value of alternative outcomes besides abstinence. A
		  focus on abstinence as the primary outcome fails to capture
		  the impact of treatment on reduction in the pattern and in
		  the frequency of alcohol consumption. In addition,
		  evaluating reduction in drinking as "positive" has value
		  for patients as an indicator of clinical progress.
		  Measurement of continuous variables, such as the quantity
		  and the frequency of alcohol consumption, has provided a
		  clearer understanding of the scope of alcohol-related
		  morbidity and mortality at the societal level, and of the
		  relationship between individual patient characteristics and
		  the naturalistic course of alcohol use, abuse, and
		  dependence. A review of these characteristics suggests that
		  there are clinical benefits associated with reducing heavy
		  drinking in alcohol-dependent patients. Given the
		  significant public health consequences associated with
		  heavy drinking and the benefits associated with its
		  reduction, it is proposed that researchers, public health
		  professionals, and clinicians consider using reduction in
		  heavy drinking as a meaningful clinical indicator of
		  treatment response, and that outcomes be individualized to
		  patients' goals and readiness to change. {\textcopyright}

###Article{	  logan1984,
  abstract	= {In the field of clinical alcohol disorders treatment in
		  North America, abstinence continues to be largely viewed as
		  the optimal treatment goal; however, there is a growing
		  awareness of limitations when abstinence is considered the
		  only successful outcome. Although this issue has been
		  discussed in research settings, new studies on the public
		  health significance of heavy drinking (defined as five or
		  more standard drinks per drinking day in men, and four or
		  more standard drinks per drinking day in women) in the past
		  10 years suggest that clinical providers should consider
		  the value of alternative outcomes besides abstinence. A
		  focus on abstinence as the primary outcome fails to capture
		  the impact of treatment on reduction in the pattern and in
		  the frequency of alcohol consumption. In addition,
		  evaluating reduction in drinking as "positive" has value
		  for patients as an indicator of clinical progress.
		  Measurement of continuous variables, such as the quantity
		  and the frequency of alcohol consumption, has provided a
		  clearer understanding of the scope of alcohol-related
		  morbidity and mortality at the societal level, and of the
		  relationship between individual patient characteristics and
		  the naturalistic course of alcohol use, abuse, and
		  dependence. A review of these characteristics suggests that
		  there are clinical benefits associated with reducing heavy
		  drinking in alcohol-dependent patients. Given the
		  significant public health consequences associated with
		  heavy drinking and the benefits associated with its
		  reduction, it is proposed that researchers, public health
		  professionals, and clinicians consider using reduction in
		  heavy drinking as a meaningful clinical indicator of
		  treatment response, and that outcomes be individualized to
		  patients' goals and readiness to change. {\textcopyright}

  abstract	= {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.Introduction: Research
		  on cognitive control suggests an age-related decline in
		  proactive control abilities (anticipatory control), whereas
		  reactive control (following conflict detection) seems to
		  remain intact. As proactive and reactive control abilities
		  are associated with specific brain networks, this study
		  investigated age-related effects on the neural substrates
		  associated with each kind of control. Methods: In an
		  event-related fMRI study, a modified version of the Stroop
		  task was administered to groups of 20 young and 20 older
		  healthy adults. Based on the theory of dual mechanisms of
		  control, the Stroop task has been built to induce proactive
		  or reactive control depending on task context. Results:
		  Behavioral results (p. {\textless}. 0.05) indicated faster
		  processing of interfering items in the mostly incongruent
		  (MI) than the mostly congruent (MC) context in both young
		  and older participants. fMRI results showed that reactive
		  control is associated with increased activity in left
		  frontal areas for older participants. For proactive
		  control, decreased activity in the bilateral anterior
		  cingulate cortex was associated with more activity in the
		  right middle frontal gyrus in the older than the younger
		  group. Conclusion: These observations support the
		  hypothesis that aging affects the neural networks
		  associated with reactive and proactive cognitive control
		  differentially. These age-related changes are very similar
		  to those observed in young adults with low dopamine
		  availability, suggesting that a general mechanism
		  (prefrontal dopamine availability) may modulate brain
		  networks associated with various kinds of cognitive
		  control.},

		  neuropsychiatric illness obscures the complexity of these
		  disorders. Capturing multiple dimensional measures of
		  neuropathology could facilitate the clinical and
		  neurobiological investigation of cognitive and behavioral
		  phenotypes. Methods: We developed a natural language
		  processing–based approach to extract five symptom
		  dimensions, based on the National Institute of Mental
		  Health Research Domain Criteria definitions, from narrative
		  clinical notes. Estimates of Research Domain Criteria
		  loading were derived from a cohort of 3619 individuals with

		  corpus of psychiatric inpatient admission and discharge
		  notes (2010–2015), and using the same cohort we examined
		  face validity, predictive validity, and convergent validity
		  with gold standard annotations. Results: In mixed-effect

  abstract	= {Everyday life requires frequent shifts between cognitive
		  tasks. Research reviewed in this article probes the control
		  processes that reconfigure mental resources for a change of
		  task by requiring subjects to switch frequently among a
		  small set of simple tasks. Subjects' responses are
		  substantially slower and, usually, more error-prone
		  immediately after a task switch. This 'switch cost' is
		  reduced, but not eliminated, by an opportunity for
		  preparation. It seems to result from both transient and
		  long-term carry-over of 'task-set' activation and
		  inhibition as well as time consumed by task-set
		  reconfiguration processes. Neuroimaging studies of task
		  switching have revealed extra activation in numerous brain
		  regions when subjects prepare to change tasks and when they
		  perform a changed task, but we cannot yet separate
		  'controlling' from 'controlled' regions.},

		  equivocal regarding the direction of this modulation. Here,
		  we tested the hypothesis that a crucial determinant of this
		  modulation is whether affective stimuli represent

		  Combining functional magnetic resonance imag- ing with a
		  conflict task-switching paradigm, we contrasted the effects
		  of presenting negative- and positive-valence pictures on
		  the stability/flexibility trade-off in humans, depending on
		  whether picture presentation was contingent on behavioral
		  performance. Both the behavioral and neural expressions of
		  cognitive control were modulated by stimulus valence and
		  performance contingency: in the performance-contingent
		  condition, cognitive flexibility was enhanced following
		  positive pictures, whereas in the nonperformance-
		  contingent condition, positive stimuli promoted cognitive
		  stability. The imaging data showed that, as anticipated,
		  the stability/flexibility trade-off per se was reflected in
		  differential recruitment of dorsolateral frontoparietal and

		  (experiment 2). Group differences were further decreased
		  after students studied their notes (experiment 2). A
		  meta-analysis (combining direct replications) of test
		  performance revealed small (nonsignificant) effects

		  and functional differences in the brain, even in the
		  absence of neurodegenerative disease. Functional magnetic
		  resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported increased
		  bilateral activation during task performance in elderly
		  participants compared to their younger counterparts,
		  particularly in frontal regions. Alterations have also been
		  observed in the functional architecture of the resting
		  brain, suggesting that aging is associated with changes in
		  the organization of the networks of the brain. However,
		  previous studies have largely focused on the default mode
		  network, and little is known about the effects of age on
		  other resting state-networks (RSNs). The aim of the present
		  study was to investigate age-differences in resting state
		  functional connectivity (RSFC) using fMRI data obtained
		  during rest from 238 healthy participants aged 21-80.
		  years. Using independent component analysis (ICA) and
		  dual-regression, the results revealed age-related increases
		  in RSFC across a range of RSNs, including task-positive
		  networks in frontal and parietal regions. In contrast,
		  age-related reductions in the default mode network and
		  occipital visual networks were observed. Furthermore,
		  whereas the effects of age on the various RSNs were found
		  independent of age-related decreases in gray matter volume,
		  sex and subject motion, we report strong positive and

  abstract	= {Cognitive aging is accompanied by a range of structural
		  and functional differences in the brain, even in the
		  absence of neurodegenerative disease. Functional magnetic
		  resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported increased
		  bilateral activation during task performance in elderly
		  participants compared to their younger counterparts,
		  particularly in frontal regions. Alterations have also been
		  observed in the functional architecture of the resting
		  brain, suggesting that aging is associated with changes in
		  the organization of the networks of the brain. However,
		  previous studies have largely focused on the default mode
		  network, and little is known about the effects of age on
		  other resting state-networks (RSNs). The aim of the present
		  study was to investigate age-differences in resting state
		  functional connectivity (RSFC) using fMRI data obtained
		  during rest from 238 healthy participants aged 21-80.
		  years. Using independent component analysis (ICA) and
		  dual-regression, the results revealed age-related increases
		  in RSFC across a range of RSNs, including task-positive
		  networks in frontal and parietal regions. In contrast,
		  age-related reductions in the default mode network and
		  occipital visual networks were observed. Furthermore,
		  whereas the effects of age on the various RSNs were found
		  independent of age-related decreases in gray matter volume,
		  sex and subject motion, we report strong positive and
		  widespread effects of estimated subject motion on the RSFC
		  across RSNs. The results provide support for the notion of

  abstract	= {A prerequisite for a pattern analysis using functional
		  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is estimating the
		  patterns from time series data, which then are input into
		  the pattern analysis. Here we focus on how the combination
		  of study design (order and spacing of trials) with pattern
		  estimator impacts the Type I error rate of the subsequent
		  pattern analysis. When Type I errors are inflated, the
		  results are no longer valid, so this work serves as a guide
		  for designing and analyzing MVPA studies with controlled
		  false positive rates. The MVPA strategies examined are
		  pattern classification and similarity, utilizing single
		  trial activation patterns from the same functional run.
		  Primarily focusing on the Least Squares Single and Least
		  Square All pattern estimators, we show that collinearities
		  in the models, along with temporal autocorrelation, can
		  cause false positive correlations between activation
		  pattern estimates that adversely impact the false positive
		  rates of pattern similarity and classification analyses. It
		  may seem intuitive that increasing the interstimulus
		  interval (ISI) would alleviate this issue, but remaining
		  weak correlations between activation patterns persist and
		  have a strong influence in pattern similarity analyses.
		  Pattern similarity analyses using only activation patterns
		  estimated from the same functional run of data are
		  susceptible to inflated false positives unless trials are
		  randomly ordered, with a different randomization for each
		  subject. In other cases, where there is any structure to
		  trial order, valid pattern similarity analysis results can
		  only be obtained if similarity computations are restricted
		  to pairs of activation patterns from independent runs.
		  Likewise, for pattern classification, false positives are
		  minimized when the testing and training sets in cross
		  validation do not contain patterns estimated from the same
		  run.},

		  area (within the aI). Therefore, we apply a novel technique
		  (Cohen et al. 2008) that utilizes resting state functional
		  connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to determine whether separable
		  regions exist within the aI. rs-fcMRI mapping suggests that
		  the ventral portion of the aI is distinguishable from more
		  dorsal/anterior regions, which are themselves distinct from
		  more posterior parts of the aI. When these regions are
		  applied to functional MRI (fMRI) data, the ventral and

		  related to the capture of focal attention. Task-level
		  control and focal attention may or may not reflect
		  information processing supported by a single functional
		  area (within the aI). Therefore, we apply a novel technique
		  (Cohen et al. 2008) that utilizes resting state functional
		  connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to determine whether separable
		  regions exist within the aI. rs-fcMRI mapping suggests that
		  the ventral portion of the aI is distinguishable from more
		  dorsal/anterior regions, which are themselves distinct from
		  more posterior parts of the aI. When these regions are
		  applied to functional MRI (fMRI) data, the ventral and
		  dorsal/anterior regions support processes potentially
		  related to both task-level control and focal attention,
		  whereas the more posterior aI regions did not. These
		  findings suggest that there exists some functional
		  heterogeneity within aI that may subserve related but
		  distinct types of higher-order cognitive processing.},

@Article{	  noble2019116157,
  abstract	= {Background Once considered mere noise, fMRI-based
		  functional connectivity has become a major neuroscience
		  tool in part due to early studies demonstrating its
		  reliability. These fundamental studies revealed only the
		  tip of the iceberg; over the past decade, many test-retest
		  reliability studies have continued to add nuance to our
		  understanding of this complex topic. A summary of these
		  diverse and at times contradictory perspectives is needed.
		  Objectives We aimed to summarize the existing knowledge
		  regarding test-retest reliability of functional
		  connectivity at the most basic unit of analysis: the
		  individual edge level. This entailed (1) a meta-analytic
		  estimate of reliability and (2) a review of factors
		  influencing reliability. Methods A search of Scopus was
		  conducted to identify studies that estimated edge-level
		  test-retest reliability. To facilitate comparisons across
		  studies, eligibility was restricted to studies measuring
		  reliability via the intraclass correlation coefficient
		  (ICC). The meta-analysis included a random effects pooled
		  estimate of mean edge-level ICC, with studies nested within
		  datasets. The review included a narrative summary of
		  factors influencing edge-level ICC. Results From an initial
		  pool of 212 studies, 44 studies were identified for the
		  qualitative review and 25 studies for quantitative
		  meta-analysis. On average, individual edges exhibited a
		  “poor” ICC of 0.29 (95{\%} CI = 0.23 to 0.36). The
		  most reliable measurements tended to involve: (1) stronger,
		  within-network, cortical edges, (2) eyes open, awake, and
		  active recordings, (3) more within-subject data, (4)
		  shorter test-retest intervals, (5) no artifact correction
		  (likely due in part to reliable artifact), and (6) full
		  correlation-based connectivity with shrinkage. Conclusion
		  This study represents the first meta-analysis and
		  systematic review investigating test-retest reliability of
		  edge-level functional connectivity. Key findings suggest
		  there is room for improvement, but care should be taken to
		  avoid promoting reliability at the expense of validity. By
		  pooling existing knowledge regarding this key facet of
		  accuracy, this study supports broader efforts to improve
		  inferences in the field.},

		  {\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}
		  
		  Abstract
		  Survival in a fast-changing environment requires animals
		  not only to detect unexpected sensory events, but also to
		  react. In humans, these salient sensory events generate
		  large electrocortical responses, which have been
		  traditionally interpreted within the sensory domain. Here
		  we describe a basic physiological mechanism coupling
		  saliency-related cortical responses with motor output. In
		  four experiments conducted on 70 healthy participants, we
		  show that salient sub-startle sensory stimuli modulate
		  isometric force exertion by human participants, and that
		  this modulation is tightly coupled with electrocortical
		  activity elicited by the same stimuli. We obtained four
		  main results. First, the force modulation follows a complex
		  triphasic pattern consisting of alternating decreases and
		  increases of force, time-locked to stimulus onset. Second,
		  this modulation occurs regardless of the sensory modality
		  of the eliciting stimulus. Third, the magnitude of the
		  force modulation is predicted by the amplitude of the
		  electrocortical activity elicited by the same stimuli.
		  Fourth, both neural and motor effects are not reflexive,
		  but depend on contextual factors. Taken together, these
		  results indicate that sudden environmental stimuli have an
		  immediate effect on motor processing, through a
		  cortico-muscular coupling. These observations suggest that
		  saliency detection is not merely perceptive but reactive,
		  preparing the animal for subsequent appropriate actions.
		  
		  Significance statement
		  
		  Salient events occurring in the environment, regardless of
		  their modalities, elicit large electrical brain responses,
		  dominated by a widespread “vertex” negative-positive
		  potential. This response is the largest synchronization of
		  neural activity that can be recorded from a healthy human
		  being. All current interpretations assume that this vertex
		  potential reflects sensory processes. Contrary to this
		  general assumption, we show that the vertex potential is
		  strongly coupled with a modulation of muscular activity
		  that follows the same pattern. Both the vertex potential
		  and its motor effects are not reflexive, but strongly
		  depend on contextual factors. These results reconceptualise
		  the significance of these evoked electrocortical responses

  abstract	= {Introduction: Impulsive behaviours commonly manifest in
		  treated Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and, are
		  typically viewed as sequelae of dopaminergic therapy.
		  However, recent evidence shows that impulsivity in those
		  patients may not only depend on medication status. Instead,
		  there is the suggestion that dopaminergic therapy interacts
		  with existing neuroanatomical and/or neurochemical
		  abnormalities, to produce impulsive behaviour in certain
		  vulnerable patients. Methods: In this study, we
		  investigated whether grey matter atrophy in fronto-striatal
		  brain regions contributes to inhibitory dysfunction - a key
		  feature of impulsive behaviour - in PD. Importantly, we
		  contrasted 25 PD patients with 11 behavioural variant
		  frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, who have
		  well-established inhibitory dysfunction and related grey
		  matter atrophy. We employed a questionnaire to assess
		  impulsive behaviours (Barrett Impulsiveness Scale), and
		  measures of verbal inhibitory function (Hayling Test) and
		  response inhibitory function (a go/no-go task). Behavioural
		  analyses were conducted to examine performance in the PD
		  and bvFTD patients and in 15 healthy controls. Scores on
		  the verbal and response inhibition tasks were also entered
		  as covariates in a region of interest voxel-based
		  morphometry analysis, to determine the grey matter
		  correlates. Results: PD patients showed impairments in
		  inhibitory function, though to a milder degree than bvFTD
		  patients. In the Parkinson's sample, frontal atrophy
		  (namely, orbitofrontal and right inferior frontal cortex)
		  was shown to correlate with verbal disinhibition, and
		  striatal atrophy (right nucleus accumbens) was associated
		  with response disinhibition, whereas a more distributed
		  pattern of fronto-striatal atrophy was associated with the
		  bvFTD patients' performance on inhibitory measures.
		  Conclusions: These results provide the first evidence that
		  disinhibition in PD is related to fronto-striatal grey
		  matter atrophy. Our study adds support to the hypothesis
		  that impulsivity in PD is not solely mediated by
		  dopaminergic medication effects, but that fronto-striatal

		  For each of these roles, we propose a neuronal microcircuit

		  which are corroborated by computational network models.
		  This conceptual approach accounts for the various roles of

		  distinct patterns of transient brain activity and needs to
		  be studied as an imaging biomarker in the aging process.},

  abstract	= {Recent neuroscientific findings suggest that functional
		  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based brain–computer
		  interfacesmay be a viable strategy for detecting covert
		  awareness in patients clinically diagnosed as being in a
		  vegetative state. This researchmay open a promising new
		  avenue for developing neuroimaging techniques that provide
		  prognostic and diagnostic information that complements
		  current behavioral tests for assessing disorders of
		  consciousness, thereby increasing the effectiveness of
		  diagnostic screening. These techniques may also permit
		  patients who are behaviorally nonresponsive yet retain high
		  levels of preserved cognition to meaningfully engage in
		  clinical decision making. Before this application can
		  occur, certain ethical issues associated with
		  decision-making capacity must be addressed. Although it is
		  not currently possible to assess decision-making capacity
		  through neuroimaging methods, it may be in the future,
		  provided that certain conceptual and empirical steps are
		  taken to demonstrate that brain–computer interfaces

		  We hypothesized that HRFv confounds FC estimates in the

		  hypothesis using both simulations (where the ground truth

		  using 2 pipelines: data with hemodynamic deconvolution (DC)

		  were compared, along with regional HRF differences,
		  revealing potential false connectivities that resulted from

  abstract	= {Comments on the article by K. C. Berridge (see record
		  2007-06749-002). Ideas about the functions of the central
		  dopamine (DA) system may seem to have evolved quite
		  considerably in the last decade. One of the main thrusts of
		  Berridge's article is a critical analysis of the role of DA
		  in reinforcement learning, and to differentiate his account
		  from a learning standpoint. The present authors are
		  assigned one of the competing perspectives to Berridge's
		  "incentive sensitization" hypothesis in terms of their
		  speculations on the role of DA in habit learning. They
		  state, however, that their position is a much more general
		  one that in many ways is in harmony with that of Berridge,
		  although on the basis of very different evidence. (PsycINFO

		  Considered less stressful than water mazes, the Barnes maze

		  Here, we tested beat-based timing over two sessions in

		  discrimination task in which participants compared two

		  test for the effects of beat structure, as well as
		  differences between participants with PD and controls, and

		  learning and decision-making: the lateral orbitofrontal
		  cortex, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and adjacent
		  medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and
		  the anterior lateral prefrontal cortex. We attempt to
		  identify common themes in experiments with human

  abstract	= {The complex processing architecture underlying attentional
		  control requires delineation of the functional role of
		  different control-related brain networks. A key component
		  is the cingulo-opercular (CO) network composed of anterior
		  insula/operculum, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and
		  thalamus. Its function has been particularly difficult to
		  characterize due to the network's pervasive activity and
		  frequent co-activation with other control-related networks.
		  We previously suggested this network to underlie
		  intrinsically maintained tonic alertness. Here, we tested
		  this hypothesis by separately manipulating the demand for
		  selective attention and for tonic alertness in a
		  two-factorial, continuous pitch discrimination paradigm.
		  The 2 factors had independent behavioral effects.
		  Functional imaging revealed that activity as well as
		  functional connectivity in the CO network increased when
		  the task required more tonic alertness. Conversely,
		  heightened selective attention to pitch increased activity
		  in the dorsal attention (DAT) network but not in the CO
		  network. Across participants, performance accuracy showed
		  dissociable correlation patterns with activity in the CO,
		  DAT, and fronto-parietal (FP) control networks. These
		  results support tonic alertness as a fundamental function
		  of the CO network. They further the characterization of
		  this function as the effortful process of maintaining
		  cognitive faculties available for current processing

		  being represented. - find readings/materials from people
		  with a diverse background
		  
		  Increase awareness of problematic assumptions: - poor
		  assumptions - students will seek help when they are
		  struggling with a class - ans: set mandatory 1-1 meetings -
		  students from certain groups are not intellectual, are
		  irresponsible, are satisfied with below average grades,
		  lack ability, have high ability in particular subject
		  areas, etc. - ans: have high expectations for all students,
		  set meetings if students fall below a certain threshold.
		  Important to make initial contact, but let students carry
		  the conversation forward - students from certain
		  backgrounds are poor writers. - ans: don't assume, give an
		  ungraded written assignment using the writing structure
		  necessary in the class to identify students that may need
		  additional help. - poor writing suggests limited
		  intellectual ability - ans: be explicit about what is
		  expected and share examples of good writing done by other
		  students (give resources to improve writing) - older
		  students/students with physical disabilities are slower
		  learners and require more attention from the instructor. -
		  ans: just isn't true - students whose cultural affiliation
		  is tied to non-english speaking groups are not native
		  english speakers or are bilingual - ans: ascertain language
		  ability in one-one meetings, don't do it in class - people
		  of certain backgrounds are spokespeople for that background
		  and europeans do not have opinions on race - ans: pose
		  questions to class, and not to certain groups
		  
		  - students from group are a monolith and necessarily
		  different from the majority - encourage all different view
		  types/perspectives regardless of person. - in readings,
		  students will only relate to characters that resemble them
		  - ans:white person can relate to a black character, probe
		  the relationship. - students from certain groups are likely
		  to have more conflict and be more extreme - ans: start
		  discussions with writing exercise to better develop
		  viewpoints/perspectives.
		  
		  planning considerations - read the calendar for any
		  religious holidays recognized by the university - contact
		  disabilities service for information about accomadations -
		  ask students at beginning to let you know about any
		  holidays absences they may have during the semester - alway
		  record attendance (since some students are more visible
		  than others and it may bias your attention on who has been
		  more absent)
		  
		  - assess ability at the beginning of the class to see what
		  prior experiences students have had
		  
		  - be aware of my preferred instructional strategies
		  
		  - at the beginning of the semester do more group activities
		  so the students and you interact more to get to know each
		  other.
		  
		  - don't let students self form groups (unless explicit
		  criteria for making the group diverse is included)
		  
		  - when in groups, make sure students switch roles
		  throughout the semester so they have experience with both
		  roles
		  
		  Getting to know the students: - have the students write a
		  brief autobiography in the beginning of the semester ( ask
		  for students experiences in math in science or relationship
		  with math/science over their life.) - also ask how they
		  learn best - examine course content for weaknesses
		  
		  - acknowledge what you don't know - make decisions about
		  when to devote unanticipated time to class discussions to
		  deal with issues raised by students.
		  
		  - do not sound dismissal of any student comments},

  abstract	= {Reward prediction errors consist of the differences
		  between received and predicted rewards. They are crucial
		  for basic forms of learning about rewards and make us
		  strive for more rewards-an evolutionary beneficial trait.
		  Most dopamine neurons in the midbrain of humans, monkeys,
		  and rodents signal a reward prediction error; they are
		  activated by more reward than predicted (positive
		  prediction error), remain at baseline activity for fully
		  predicted rewards, and show depressed activity with less
		  reward than predicted (negative prediction error). The
		  dopamine signal increases nonlinearly with reward value and
		  codes formal economic utility. Drugs of addiction generate,
		  hijack, and amplify the dopamine reward signal and induce
		  exaggerated, uncontrolled dopamine effects on neuronal
		  plasticity. The striatum, amygdala, and frontal cortex also
		  show reward prediction error coding, but only in
		  subpopulations of neurons. Thus, the important concept of

  abstract	= {Reward prediction errors consist of the differences
		  between received and predicted rewards. They are crucial
		  for basic forms of learning about rewards and make us
		  strive for more rewards-an evolutionary beneficial trait.
		  Most dopamine neurons in the midbrain of humans, monkeys,
		  and rodents signal a reward prediction error; they are
		  activated by more reward than predicted (positive
		  prediction error), remain at baseline activity for fully
		  predicted rewards, and show depressed activity with less
		  reward than predicted (negative prediction error). The
		  dopamine signal increases nonlinearly with reward value and
		  codes formal economic utility. Drugs of addiction generate,
		  hijack, and amplify the dopamine reward signal and induce
		  exaggerated, uncontrolled dopamine effects on neuronal
		  plasticity. The striatum, amygdala, and frontal cortex also
		  show reward prediction error coding, but only in
		  subpopulations of neurons. Thus, the important concept of
		  reward prediction errors is implemented in neuronal
		  hardware.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAbstract available from

		  in circadian patterns is a common feature of aging and
		  predicts pathology, little is known about how alterations

		  underwent fMRI while performing an associative memory task.
		  The results revealed better associative memory was related
		  to more consistent circadian activity rhythms, independent
		  of total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and level of
		  physical activity. Moreover, hippocampal activity during
		  successful memory retrieval events was positively
		  correlated with associative memory accuracy and circadian
		  activity rhythm (CAR) consistency. We demonstrated that the
		  link between consistent rhythms and associative memory
		  performance was mediated by hippocampal activity. These
		  findings provide novel insight into how the circadian

		  Comments on an article by R. Chowdhury et al. (see record
		  [rid]2013-17132-023[/rid]). Until now, studies of aging in
		  humans have measured mostly decision behavior and, in some
		  cases, decision-related brain activity. But rarely have
		  studies manipulated dopamine levels directly in healthy
		  older humans. Without a direct manipulation of dopamine in
		  humans, any link between decisions, aging and dopaminergic
		  function remains speculative. The experiment reported by
		  Chowdhury et al., where the authors directly manipulated
		  dopamine levels in healthy older people, fills this gap and
		  provides new and important information about how dopamine
		  affects learning and decision-making in the aging brain.
		  Chowdhury et al. used a combination of powerful methods to
		  probe the link between brain and behavior: pharmacological
		  manipulation, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
		  diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a sophisticated and
		  well-understood reinforcement learning task, and
		  computational models of behavior. This combination of
		  methods revealed that increasing dopamine levels in the
		  brain of healthy older participants increased the rate with
		  which they learned from rewarding outcomes and changed
		  activity in the striatum, a brain region that supports
		  learning from rewards. Thus, by bringing together disparate
		  methods, the authors were able to ask questions and obtain
		  answers that would not otherwise be possible. Chowdhury et
		  al. reasoned that the strength of the connection between
		  midbrain dopamine neurons and the striatum could relate to
		  striatal activation to reward. To test this, the authors
		  used DTI, an MRI measure of anatomical connectivity. This
		  technique measures the directions in which water molecules
		  are free to diffuse. Because the narrow confines of an axon
		  constrain the movement of cytoplasmic water, this method
		  can be used to trace axonal bundles and thereby reveal
		  connections between regions. They found that the strength
		  of connectivity between the midbrain and the striatum
		  indeed correlated with striatal activation in response to
		  the expected reward. Chowdhury et al. focused on expected
		  reward and reward feedback exclusively in the striatum, but
		  drug-induced changes in other brain areas could also have
		  contributed to the present findings. Dopamine neurons
		  target other brain regions that are important for learning
		  and decision-making, such as the ventromedial prefrontal
		  cortex (VMPFC) and the hippocampus. One of the most
		  important objectives for studying the aging brain is to
		  link brain changes with behavioral impairments shown in
		  some areas of decision-making, for example, in managing
		  finances and choosing insurance plans. Chowdhury et al.
		  used a reward learning experiment that is simple and
		  well-studied. In conclusion, the results presented by
		  Chowdhury et al. provide an important link between
		  dopamine, brain activity and behavior. One of the most
		  striking aspects of this study is its use of many different
		  tools to address a single, important question. In addition,
		  this allows for important connections to be made between
		  our understanding of dopamine function in younger adults
		  and dopamine dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. From here,
		  future research can further our understanding of dopamine
		  in aging and disease, perhaps even figuring out if we
		  should be on dopamine replacement therapy as we grow older.

		  link brain changes with behavioral impairments shown in
		  some areas of decision-making, for example, in managing
		  finances and choosing insurance plans. Chowdhury et al.
		  used a reward learning experiment that is simple and
		  well-studied. In conclusion, the results presented by
		  Chowdhury et al. provide an important link between
		  dopamine, brain activity and behavior. One of the most
		  striking aspects of this study is its use of many different
		  tools to address a single, important question. In addition,
		  this allows for important connections to be made between
		  our understanding of dopamine function in younger adults
		  and dopamine dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. From here,
		  future research can further our understanding of dopamine
		  in aging and disease, perhaps even figuring out if we
		  should be on dopamine replacement therapy as we grow older.

  abstract	= {More Americans are consuming diets higher in saturated
		  fats and refined sugars than ever before, and based on
		  increasing obesity rates, this is a growing trend among
		  older adults as well. While high saturated fat diet (HFD)
		  consumption has been shown to sensitize the inflammatory
		  response to a subsequent immune challenge in young adult
		  rats, the inflammatory effect of HFD in the
		  already-vulnerable aging brain has not yet been assessed.
		  Here, we explored whether short-term (3 days) consumption
		  of HFD would serve as a neuroinflammatory trigger in aging
		  animals, leading to cognitive deficits. HFD impaired
		  long-term contextual (hippocampal dependent) and
		  auditory-cued fear (amygdalar dependent) memory in aged,
		  but not young adult rats. Short-term memory performance for
		  both tasks was intact, suggesting that HFD impairs memory
		  consolidation processes. Microglial markers of activation
		  Iba1 and cd11b were only increased in the aged rats, while
		  MHCII was further amplified by HFD. Furthermore, these
		  HFD-induced long-term memory impairments were accompanied
		  by IL-1$\beta$ protein increases in both the hippocampus
		  and amygdala in aged rats. Central administration of IL-1RA
		  in aged rats following conditioning mitigated both
		  contextual and auditory-cued fear memory impairments caused
		  by HFD, strongly suggesting that IL-1$\beta$ plays a
		  critical role in these effects. Voluntary wheel running,
		  known to have anti-inflammatory effects in the hippocampus,
		  rescued hippocampal-dependent but not amygdalar-dependent
		  memory impairments caused by HFD. Together, these data
		  suggest that short-term consumption of HFD can lead to
		  memory deficits and significant brain inflammation in the
		  aged animal, and strongly suggest that appropriate diet is
		  crucial for cognitive health.},

  abstract	= {More Americans are consuming diets higher in saturated
		  fats and refined sugars than ever before, and based on
		  increasing obesity rates, this is a growing trend among
		  older adults as well. While high saturated fat diet (HFD)
		  consumption has been shown to sensitize the inflammatory
		  response to a subsequent immune challenge in young adult
		  rats, the inflammatory effect of HFD in the
		  already-vulnerable aging brain has not yet been assessed.
		  Here, we explored whether short-term (3 days) consumption
		  of HFD would serve as a neuroinflammatory trigger in aging
		  animals, leading to cognitive deficits. HFD impaired
		  long-term contextual (hippocampal dependent) and
		  auditory-cued fear (amygdalar dependent) memory in aged,
		  but not young adult rats. Short-term memory performance for
		  both tasks was intact, suggesting that HFD impairs memory
		  consolidation processes. Microglial markers of activation
		  Iba1 and cd11b were only increased in the aged rats, while
		  MHCII was further amplified by HFD. Furthermore, these
		  HFD-induced long-term memory impairments were accompanied
		  by IL-1$\beta$ protein increases in both the hippocampus
		  and amygdala in aged rats. Central administration of IL-1RA
		  in aged rats following conditioning mitigated both
		  contextual and auditory-cued fear memory impairments caused
		  by HFD, strongly suggesting that IL-1$\beta$ plays a
		  critical role in these effects. Voluntary wheel running,
		  known to have anti-inflammatory effects in the hippocampus,
		  rescued hippocampal-dependent but not amygdalar-dependent
		  memory impairments caused by HFD. Together, these data
		  suggest that short-term consumption of HFD can lead to
		  memory deficits and significant brain inflammation in the
		  aged animal, and strongly suggest that appropriate diet is
		  crucial for cognitive health.},

		  decision-making behavior, and the behavioral impairments
		  observed in these cases are often attributed to the general

		  of the frontal lobes of the brain, is widely believed to be
		  involved in the regulation of attention. Beyond this,
		  however, its specific contribution to cognition remains
		  uncertain. One influential theory has interpreted
		  activation within the ACC as reflecting
		  'selection-for-action', a set of processes that guide the
		  selection of environmental objects as triggers of or
		  targets for action. We have proposed an alternative
		  hypothesis, in which the ACC serves not to exert top-down
		  attentional control but instead to detect and signal the
		  occurrence of conflicts in information processing. Here, to
		  test this theory against the selection-for-action theory,
		  we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure
		  brain activation during performance of a task where, for a
		  particular subset of trials, the strength of
		  selection-for-action is inversely related to the degree of
		  response conflict. Activity within the ACC was greater
		  during trials featuring high levels of conflict (and weak
		  selection-for-action) than during trials with low levels of
		  conflict (and strong selection-for-action), providing
		  evidence in favour of the conflict-monitoring account of
		  ACC function.},

		  neural circuits are implicated in several aspects of
		  cognitive and memory processes. The present review is
		  dedicated to the description of the anatomo-functional
		  characteristics of the hippocampo-prefrontal pathway and
		  related neuronal circuits in the rat. This pathway, which
		  originates from the hippocampal CA1/subiculum fields,
		  innervates the prelimbic/medial orbital areas of the
		  prefrontal cortex (PL/MO). Its synaptic influence on
		  cortical pyramidal neurons consists in an early
		  monosynaptic excitation followed by an inhibition and, in

		  likely due to the subsequent activation of the local
		  cortical network. PL/MO areas and the CA1/subiculum both
		  send projections to the nucleus accumbens, a region of the
		  ventral striatum which is particularly implicated in
		  goal-directed behavior. Therefore, emphasis is placed on
		  respective projections from PL/MO areas and from the
		  CA1/subiculum on the "core" and the "shell" regions of the
		  nucleus accumbens, as well as on their interconnected
		  circuits. Signals which are directed to the prefrontal

		  representative sample of the U.S. population. METHODS:
		  These results were obtained from the 2003-2004 National

		  sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S.

		  more physically active than females. Physical activity
		  declines dramatically across age groups between childhood
		  and adolescence and continues to decline with age. For

  abstract	= {The pretest-posttest control group design can be analyzed
		  with the posttest as dependent variable and the pretest as
		  covariate (ANCOVA) or with the difference between posttest
		  and pretest as dependent variable (CHANGE). These 2 methods
		  can give contradictory results if groups differ at pretest,
		  a phenomenon that is known as Lord's paradox.Literature
		  claims that ANCOVAis preferable if treatment assignment is
		  based on randomization or on the pretest and questionable
		  for preexisting groups. Some literature suggests that
		  Lord's paradox has to do with measurement error in the
		  pretest. This article shows two new things: First, the
		  claims are confirmed by proving the mathematical
		  equivalence of ANCOVA to a repeated measures model without
		  group effect at pretest. Second, correction for measurement
		  error in the pretest is shown to lead back to ANCOVA or to
		  CHANGE, depending on the assumed absence or presence of a
		  true group differ- ence at pretest. These two new
		  theoretical results are illustrated with multilevel (mixed)
		  regression and structural equation modeling of data from

		  control, response facilitation and response inhibition, in
		  an adult lifespan sample (N = 544, age range = 18–91
		  years) by administering two response-preparation tasks: a
		  procue task, primarily involving facilitation, and an
		  anticue task, involving both facilitation and inhibition.
		  Cues in both tasks corresponded with the index and middle
		  fingers of either the left or right hand. After a random
		  preparation interval (PI) of 100–850 ms following the
		  onset of the cue signal, a single-target stimulus indicated
		  the required response. Where procues were spatially aligned
		  with the two fingers of the responding hand, anticues
		  consistently indicated the two fingers of the opposite
		  hand, requiring a remapping of cue location and response
		  hand. This remapping requires inhibition to suppress the
		  automatic activation of the ipsilateral responses. Previous

		  described the data well (R² = .83) and confirmed that no

		  Likewise, no Age × Condition interaction was found when

		  ratio of decay rates was estimated to be 1.4. Consequently,
		  the apparent age-sensitivity of the Stroop interference
		  effect appears to be merely an artifact of general

  abstract	= {Performance in most complex cognitive and psychomotor
		  tasks improves with training, yet the extent of improvement
		  varies among individuals. Is it possible to forecast the
		  benefit that a person might reap from training? Several
		  behavioral measures have been used to predict individual
		  differences in task improvement, but their predictive power
		  is limited. Here we show that individual differences in
		  patterns of time-averaged T2*-weighted MRI images in the
		  dorsal striatum recorded at the initial stage of training
		  predict subsequent learning success in a complex video game
		  with high accuracy. These predictions explained more than
		  half of the variance in learning success among individuals,
		  suggesting that individual differences in neuroanatomy or
		  persistent physiology predict whether and to what extent
		  people will benefit from training in a complex task.
		  Surprisingly, predictions from white matter were highly
		  accurate, while voxels in the gray matter of the dorsal
		  striatum did not contain any information about future
		  training success. Prediction accuracy was higher in the
		  anterior than the posterior half of the dorsal striatum.
		  The link between trainability and the time-averaged
		  T2*-weighted signal in the dorsal striatum reaffirms the
		  role of this part of the basal ganglia in learning and
		  executive functions, such as task-switching and task
		  coordination processes. The ability to predict who will
		  benefit from training by using neuroimaging data collected
		  in the early training phase may have far-reaching
		  implications for the assessment of candidates for specific
		  training programs as well as the study of populations that
		  show deficiencies in learning new skills.},

  abstract	= {Performance in most complex cognitive and psychomotor
		  tasks improves with training, yet the extent of improvement
		  varies among individuals. Is it possible to forecast the
		  benefit that a person might reap from training? Several
		  behavioral measures have been used to predict individual
		  differences in task improvement, but their predictive power
		  is limited. Here we show that individual differences in
		  patterns of time-averaged T2*-weighted MRI images in the
		  dorsal striatum recorded at the initial stage of training
		  predict subsequent learning success in a complex video game
		  with high accuracy. These predictions explained more than
		  half of the variance in learning success among individuals,
		  suggesting that individual differences in neuroanatomy or
		  persistent physiology predict whether and to what extent
		  people will benefit from training in a complex task.
		  Surprisingly, predictions from white matter were highly
		  accurate, while voxels in the gray matter of the dorsal
		  striatum did not contain any information about future
		  training success. Prediction accuracy was higher in the
		  anterior than the posterior half of the dorsal striatum.
		  The link between trainability and the time-averaged
		  T2*-weighted signal in the dorsal striatum reaffirms the
		  role of this part of the basal ganglia in learning and
		  executive functions, such as task-switching and task
		  coordination processes. The ability to predict who will
		  benefit from training by using neuroimaging data collected
		  in the early training phase may have far-reaching
		  implications for the assessment of candidates for specific
		  training programs as well as the study of populations that
		  show deficiencies in learning new skills.},

		  In a group of healthy individuals, we searched for

		  midbrain areas (substantia nigra; ventral tegmental area)
		  and a striatal region (caudate) that was modulated by both
		  a pharmacological challenge (the administration of the
		  dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine) and a
		  dopamine-sensitive cognitive trait (an individual's working

		  state fMRI data is sufficiently powerful to identify
		  brainstem neuromodulatory brain networks.},

@Article{	  waskom2014,
  abstract	= {Cognitive control allows stimulus-response processing to
		  be aligned with internal goals and is thus central to
		  intelligent, purposeful behavior. Control is thought to
		  depend in part on the active representation of task
		  information in prefrontal cortex (PFC), which provides a
		  source of contextual bias on perception, decision making,
		  and action. In the present study, we investigated the
		  organization, influences, and consequences of context
		  representation as human subjects performed a cued sorting
		  task that required them to flexibly judge the relationship
		  between pairs of multivalent stimuli. Using a
		  connectivity-based parcellation of PFC and multivariate
		  decoding analyses, we determined that context is
		  specifically and transiently represented in a region
		  spanning the inferior frontal sulcus during
		  context-dependent decision making. We also found strong
		  evidence that decision context is represented within the
		  intraparietal sulcus, an area previously shown to be
		  functionally networked with the inferior frontal sulcus at
		  rest and during task performance. Rule-guided allocation of
		  attention to different stimulus dimensions produced
		  discriminable patterns of activation in visual cortex,
		  providing a signature of top-down bias over perception.
		  Furthermore, demands on cognitive control arising from the
		  task structure modulated context representation, which was
		  found to be strongest after a shift in task rules. When
		  context representation in frontoparietal areas increased in
		  strength, as measured by the discriminability of

###Article{	  waskom2014,
  abstract	= {Cognitive control allows stimulus-response processing to
		  be aligned with internal goals and is thus central to
		  intelligent, purposeful behavior. Control is thought to
		  depend in part on the active representation of task
		  information in prefrontal cortex (PFC), which provides a
		  source of contextual bias on perception, decision making,
		  and action. In the present study, we investigated the
		  organization, influences, and consequences of context
		  representation as human subjects performed a cued sorting
		  task that required them to flexibly judge the relationship
		  between pairs of multivalent stimuli. Using a
		  connectivity-based parcellation of PFC and multivariate
		  decoding analyses, we determined that context is
		  specifically and transiently represented in a region
		  spanning the inferior frontal sulcus during
		  context-dependent decision making. We also found strong
		  evidence that decision context is represented within the
		  intraparietal sulcus, an area previously shown to be
		  functionally networked with the inferior frontal sulcus at
		  rest and during task performance. Rule-guided allocation of
		  attention to different stimulus dimensions produced
		  discriminable patterns of activation in visual cortex,
		  providing a signature of top-down bias over perception.
		  Furthermore, demands on cognitive control arising from the
		  task structure modulated context representation, which was
		  found to be strongest after a shift in task rules. When
		  context representation in frontoparietal areas increased in
		  strength, as measured by the discriminability of
		  high-dimensional activation patterns, the bias on attended
		  stimulus features was enhanced. These results provide novel
		  evidence that illuminates the mechanisms by which humans
		  flexibly guide behavior in complex environments.},

		  information that is most relevant by which to guide our
		  actions. In the present study, we employed a well-known

		  how humans are able to learn to filter out irrelevant
		  information. We trained subjects for four days with a
		  visual stimulus presented, alternately, in central and

		  a joystick in either the left or right direction. They were
		  instructed to ignore the irrelevant location information
		  and respond based on color (e.g. red to the right and green
		  to the left). On the fifth day, an additional testing
		  session was conducted where the task changed and the
		  subjects had to respond by shape (e.g. triangle to the
		  right and rectangle to the left). They were instructed to
		  ignore the color and location, and respond based solely on
		  the task relevant shape. We found that the magnitude of the
		  Simon effect decreases with training, however it returns in
		  the first few trials after a break. Furthermore,
		  task-defined associations between response direction and
		  color did not significantly affect the Simon effect based
		  on shape, and no significant associative learning from the
		  specific stimulus-response features was found for the

		  subnetworks of interacting brain areas. Descriptions of
		  resting-state network architecture have provided clues for
		  understanding the functional significance of these

		  distinct brain systems. The present report synthesizes
		  accumulating evidence to reveal how maintaining segregated
		  brain systems renders the human brain network functionally
		  specialized, adaptable to task demands, and largely
		  resilient following focal brain damage. The organizational
		  properties that support system segregation are harmonious
		  with the properties that promote integration across the
		  network, but confer unique and important features to the
		  brain network that are central to its function and

  abstract	= {The organization of the brain network enables its
		  function. Evaluation of this organization has revealed that
		  large-scale brain networks consist of multiple segregated
		  subnetworks of interacting brain areas. Descriptions of
		  resting-state network architecture have provided clues for
		  understanding the functional significance of these
		  segregated subnetworks, many of which correspond to
		  distinct brain systems. The present report synthesizes
		  accumulating evidence to reveal how maintaining segregated
		  brain systems renders the human brain network functionally
		  specialized, adaptable to task demands, and largely
		  resilient following focal brain damage. The organizational
		  properties that support system segregation are harmonious
		  with the properties that promote integration across the
		  network, but confer unique and important features to the
		  brain network that are central to its function and
		  behavior. Resting-state functional correlation networks

  abstract	= {Model-based analysis of fMRI data is an important tool for
		  investigating the computational role of different brain
		  regions. With this method, theoretical models of behavior
		  can be leveraged to find the brain structures underlying
		  variables from specific algorithms, such as prediction
		  errors in reinforcement learning. One potential weakness
		  with this approach is that models often have free
		  parameters and thus the results of the analysis may depend
		  on how these free parameters are set. In this work we asked
		  whether this hypothetical weakness is a problem in
		  practice. We first developed general closed-form
		  expressions for the relationship between results of fMRI
		  analyses using different regressors, e.g., one
		  corresponding to the true process underlying the measured
		  data and one a model-derived approximation of the true
		  generative regressor. Then, as a specific test case, we
		  examined the sensitivity of model-based fMRI to the
		  learning rate parameter in reinforcement learning, both in
		  theory and in two previously-published datasets. We found
		  that even gross errors in the learning rate lead to only
		  minute changes in the neural results. Our findings thus
		  suggest that precise model fitting is not always necessary
		  for model-based fMRI. They also highlight the difficulty in
		  using fMRI data for arbitrating between different models or
		  model parameters. While these specific results pertain only
		  to the effect of learning rate in simple reinforcement
		  learning models, we provide a template for testing for
		  effects of different parameters in other models.},

		  participants in a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort
		  study who had annual cognitive testing (n = 2,899) and
		  subgroups that developed incident dementia (n = 696), died,
		  and underwent a neuropathologic examination from which 10
		  neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular markers were derived
		  (n = 752), or both (n = 405). Cognitive test scores were
		  converted to a standard scale and averaged to yield
		  composite measures of cognition.Results Participants had a
		  mean of 16.3 years of education (SD = 3.7, range 0–30).
		  In all participants, education was associated with initial
		  level of global cognition but not rate of cognitive change.
		  In those who developed dementia, rate of global cognitive
		  decline accelerated a mean of 1.8 years before the
		  diagnosis, but education was not related to the onset or
		  rate of accelerated decline. In the deceased, rate of
		  global cognitive decline accelerated a mean of 3.4 years
		  before death, but higher educational attainment was related
		  to earlier (not later) onset of accelerated decline and
		  unrelated to rate of acceleration. Higher education was
		  associated with lower likelihood of gross and microscopic
		  cerebral infarcts but not with other neuropathologic
		  markers. Education was not related to global cognitive
		  change not attributable to neuropathologic burden and did
		  not decrease the association of higher neuropathologic
		  burden with more rapid cognitive decline.Conclusion The
		  results suggest that the contribution of education to
		  cognitive reserve is limited to its association with level
		  of cognitive function before old age.},

  abstract	= {The general organization of neocortical connectivity in
		  rhesus monkey is relatively well understood. However,
		  mounting evidence points to an organizing principle that
		  involves clustered synapses at the level of individual
		  dendrites. Several synaptic plasticity studies have
		  reported cooperative interaction between neighboring
		  synapses on a given dendritic branch, which may potentially
		  induce synapse clusters. Additionally, theoretical models
		  have predicted that such cooperativity is advantageous, in
		  that it greatly enhances a neuron's computational
		  repertoire. However, largely because of the lack of
		  sufficient morphologic data, the existence of clustered
		  synapses in neurons on a global scale has never been
		  established. The majority of excitatory synapses are found
		  within dendritic spines. In this study, we demonstrate that
		  spine clusters do exist on pyramidal neurons by analyzing
		  the three-dimensional locations of ∼40,000 spines on 280
		  apical dendritic branches in layer III of the rhesus monkey
		  prefrontal cortex. By using clustering algorithms and Monte
		  Carlo simulations, we quantify the probability that the
		  observed extent of clustering does not occur randomly. This
		  provides a measure that tests for spine clustering on a
		  global scale, whenever high-resolution morphologic data are
		  available. Here we demonstrate that spine clusters occur
		  significantly more frequently than expected by pure chance
		  and that spine clustering is concentrated in apical
		  terminal branches. These findings indicate that spine
		  clustering is driven by systematic biological processes. We
		  also found that mushroom-shaped and stubby spines are
		  predominant in clusters on dendritic segments that display
		  prolific clustering, independently supporting a causal link
		  between spine morphology and synaptic clustering.},

  abstract	= {Background: The theory that prefrontal cortex (PFC)
		  dysfunction in schizophrenia leads to excess subcortical
		  dopamine has generated widespread interest because it
		  provides a parsimonious account for two core features of
		  schizophrenia, cognitive deficits and psychosis,
		  respectively. However, there has been limited empirical
		  validation of this model. Moreover, the identity of the
		  specific subcortical brain regions and circuits that may be
		  impaired as a result of PFC dysfunction and mediate its
		  link to psychosis in schizophrenia remains unclear. We
		  undertook this event-related functional magnetic resonance
		  imaging study to test the hypothesis that PFC dysfunction
		  is associated with altered function of and connectivity
		  with dopamine regulating regions of the basal ganglia.
		  Methods: Eighteen individuals with schizophrenia or
		  schizoaffective disorder and 19 healthy control
		  participants completed event-related functional magnetic
		  resonance imaging during working memory. We conducted
		  between-group contrasts of task-evoked, univariate
		  activation maps to identify regions of altered function in
		  schizophrenia. We also compared the groups on the level of
		  functional connectivity between a priori identified PFC and
		  basal ganglia regions to determine if prefrontal
		  disconnectivity in patients was present. Results: We
		  observed task-evoked hyperactivity of the substantia nigra
		  that occurred in association with prefrontal and striatal
		  hypoactivity in the schizophrenia group. The magnitude of
		  prefrontal functional connectivity with these dysfunctional
		  basal ganglia regions was decreased in the schizophrenia
		  group. Additionally, the level of nigrostriatal functional
		  connectivity predicted the level of psychosis. Conclusions:
		  These results suggest that functional impairments of the
		  prefrontal striatonigral circuit may be a common pathway
		  linking the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits and
		  psychosis in schizophrenia. ?? 2013 Society of Biological

  abstract	= {Background: The theory that prefrontal cortex (PFC)
		  dysfunction in schizophrenia leads to excess subcortical
		  dopamine has generated widespread interest because it
		  provides a parsimonious account for two core features of
		  schizophrenia, cognitive deficits and psychosis,
		  respectively. However, there has been limited empirical
		  validation of this model. Moreover, the identity of the
		  specific subcortical brain regions and circuits that may be
		  impaired as a result of PFC dysfunction and mediate its
		  link to psychosis in schizophrenia remains unclear. We
		  undertook this event-related functional magnetic resonance
		  imaging study to test the hypothesis that PFC dysfunction
		  is associated with altered function of and connectivity
		  with dopamine regulating regions of the basal ganglia.
		  Methods: Eighteen individuals with schizophrenia or
		  schizoaffective disorder and 19 healthy control
		  participants completed event-related functional magnetic
		  resonance imaging during working memory. We conducted
		  between-group contrasts of task-evoked, univariate
		  activation maps to identify regions of altered function in
		  schizophrenia. We also compared the groups on the level of
		  functional connectivity between a priori identified PFC and
		  basal ganglia regions to determine if prefrontal
		  disconnectivity in patients was present. Results: We
		  observed task-evoked hyperactivity of the substantia nigra
		  that occurred in association with prefrontal and striatal
		  hypoactivity in the schizophrenia group. The magnitude of
		  prefrontal functional connectivity with these dysfunctional
		  basal ganglia regions was decreased in the schizophrenia
		  group. Additionally, the level of nigrostriatal functional
		  connectivity predicted the level of psychosis. Conclusions:
		  These results suggest that functional impairments of the
		  prefrontal striatonigral circuit may be a common pathway
		  linking the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits and
		  psychosis in schizophrenia. ?? 2013 Society of Biological

  abstract	= {A robust multi-modal tool, for automated registration,
		  bias correction, and tissue classification, has been
		  implemented for large-scale heterogeneous multi-site
		  longitudinal MR data analysis. This work focused on
		  improving the an iterative optimization framework between
		  bias-correction, registration, and tissue classification
		  inspired from previous work. The primary contributions are
		  robustness improvements from incorporation of following
		  four elements: (1) utilize multi-modal and repeated scans,
		  (2) incorporate high-deformable registration, (3) use
		  extended set of tissue definitions, and (4) use of
		  multi-modal aware intensity-context priors. The benefits of
		  these enhancements were investigated by a series of
		  experiments with both simulated brain data set (BrainWeb)
		  and by applying to highly-heterogeneous data from a 32 site
		  imaging study with quality assessments through the expert
		  visual inspection. The implementation of this tool is
		  tailored for, but not limited to, large-scale data
		  processing with great data variation with a flexible
		  interface. In this paper, we describe enhancements to a
		  joint registration, bias correction, and the tissue
		  classification, that improve the generalizability and
		  robustness for processing multi-modal longitudinal MR scans
		  collected at multi-sites. The tool was evaluated by using
		  both simulated and simulated and human subject MRI images.
		  With these enhancements, the results showed improved
		  robustness for large-scale heterogeneous MRI processing.},

abstract = {To efficiently deal with quickly changing task demands, we often need to organize our behaviour on different time scales. For example, to ignore irrelevant and select relevant information, cognitive control might be applied in reactive (short time scale) or proactive (long time scale) mode. These two control modes play a pivotal role in cognitive-neuroscientific theorizing but the temporal dissociation of the underlying neural mechanisms is not well established empirically. In this fMRI study, a cognitive control task was administered in contexts with mainly congruent (MC) and mainly incongruent (MI) trials to induce reactive and proactive control, respectively. Based on behavioural profiles, we expected cognitive control in the MC context to be characterized by transient activity (measured on-trial) in task-relevant areas. In the MI context, cognitive control was expected to be reflected in sustained activity (measured in the intertrial interval) in similar or different areas. Results show that in the MC context, on-trial transient activity (incongruent – congruent trials) was increased in fronto-parietal areas, compared to the MI context. These areas included dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). In the MI context, sustained activity in similar fronto-parietal areas during the intertrial interval was increased, compared to the MC context. These results illuminate how context-dependent reactive and proactive control subtend the same brain areas but operate on different time scales.},
